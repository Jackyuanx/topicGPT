      "Text: ,Introduction,Climate change adaptation holds equal significance to mitigation in the UAE, given that the,country is susceptible to climate change consequences that resemble those experienced by other,countries in the region. These potential effects encompass alterations in meteorological patterns,,elevated temperatures in both air and seawater, rising sea levels, and an escalation in extreme,weather occurrences. The UAE occupies a coastal region characterized by extreme aridity, where,the average annual rainfall is less than 100 mm, and water resources are scarce. During the,summer months, the temperature and humidity levels soar, with peak temperatures exceeding,49°C and humidity levels approaching 100% on exceptionally humid days.,Consequently, the projected effects of climate change will impact the UAE directly and indirectly,,touching upon its economy, environment, and societal well-being. These anticipated adverse,effects will ripple through marine and terrestrial ecosystems, agricultural productivity, and the,accessibility of water resources. Moreover, the rising sea levels pose a potential threat to vital,UAE infrastructure, including desalination and power facilities, as well as habitats situated along,coastal areas bordering the Arabian Gulf or the Gulf of Oman.,Considering the anticipated climate change,challenges, the UAE is actively rolling out a,comprehensive set of policies and initiatives at,both the national and local levels. These efforts,are aimed at enhancing resilience to climate,change and mitigating its impacts, with some,initiatives yielding co-benefits for mitigation.,The decision-making process is grounded in,extensive stakeholder engagement, which,includes private sector participation, and is,guided by the latest scientific research, to,effectively bridge the gap between science and,policy.,Moving forward, the National Climate Change,Plan will entail the development of in-depth,adaptation strategies for various key sectors,,aiming to minimize vulnerabilities and bolster,the UAE’s capacity to adapt. The National,Climate Change Plan focuses on three key,objectives (i) manage GHG emissions, (ii) build,climate resilience by managing risk and,building adaptive capacity; (iii) advance UAE’s,economic diversification agenda through,innovative solutions. Noting that National GHG,emission management systems, national,adaptation planning and management, and,private sector-based innovative diversification,programs are key climate priorities of the,country.,In line with National Climate Change Plan in,2017, MOCCAE established National Climate,Change Adaptation Program in 2018. Acquiring,an enhanced understanding of climate impacts,,prioritizing high risks, and identifying,adaptation options. Under this program,,MOCCAE conducted climate change risk,assessments for the priority sectors in 2019,and planning implementable adaptation,strategies from there onwards. Followed by,mainstreaming adaptation strategies in 2025,and conducting monitoring and evaluation to,ensure evidence-based adaptation in 2030-,2050.,MOCCAE published Risk assessment reports,in 2019 for priority sectors: Public Health,,Energy, Infrastructure, Environment, and,Insurance sector newly added (in 2021-22).,For each sector, actionable adaptation plans,are currently in the process of development at,the emirate level, aligning with the,requirements of the National Adaptation Plan,(NAP). These plans are designed to effectively,address the high-priority risks that have,previously been identified. The overarching,goal of the NAP is to emphasize, integrate,,execute, and oversee adaptation strategies,across various sectors, involving all relevant,stakeholders within both governmental and,non-governmental domains. These plans will,encompass detailed information regarding,specific actions, the responsible leaders and,supporting participants, timelines, metrics for,monitoring and evaluation, as well as,preliminary cost estimates and anticipated,impacts. This comprehensive approach is,intended to mainstream climate change,adaptation and bolster resilience within sector-,specific development strategies while,identifying crucial projects and action plans for,funding. Through the NAP, the UAE is,proactively enhancing its capacity to adapt to,the challenges of climate change by,pinpointing both short-term and long-term,priority adaptation measures.,Methodology Adopted for Climate Risk,Assessment,The methodology used to carry out climate risk,assessment adopted the guiding formula for,calculating “risk based on the magnitude and,likelihood of the climate impacts”. The 5 Step,approach is adopted which includes stock-,taking, identifying potential impacts, evaluating,impacts, assessing, and prioritizing risks, and,identifying adaptation measures together with,stakeholder consultation and monitoring and,reviewing mechanisms.,\n",

      "Text: ,As a small, low-lying island city-state, Singapore is highly vulnerable,to the impacts of climate change. Singapore is also one of the,most densely populated countries in the world. It is thus important,for Singapore to prepare for and adapt early to climate change.,Effects of Climate Change,The IPCC Working Group I Report for the AR6,cycle has warned us that the global climate will,change significantly unless rapid and drastic,reductions in emissions are taken. Global,temperatures are projected to very likely rise by,1.0–5.7 °C by the end of the century from pre-,industrial levels, while global mean sea levels are,likely expected to increase by 0.28 m to 1.01 m,over the same period, relative to 1995–2014 sea,levels. Extreme weather events (such as heavy,rainfall) over the region are also projected to be,more intense and frequent. The IPCC Working,Group II Report further cautions that widespread,climate impacts are already being felt across the,world, with some of these effects irreversibly and,disproportionately affecting vulnerable countries,,notably small island developing states (SIDS).,The window for securing a liveable future is,rapidly closing.,The Centre for Climate Research Singapore,(CCRS), in partnership with the UK,Meteorological Office, concluded Singapore’s,Second National Climate Change Study (V2) in,2015, which made use of data and scenarios from,the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) to,examine the long-term effects of climate change,in Singapore. The study found that by 2100, the,mean sea level around Singapore could rise,by up to a metre and mean temperatures could,increase by up to 4.6 °C. The CCRS has embarked,on the Third National Climate Change Study (V3),to provide updated climate projections by 2023,,which will incorporate the latest findings from,IPCC AR6.,Preparing Singapore for the Impact of,Climate Change,The impacts of climate change are already being,felt in Singapore. 2012 to 2021 was Singapore’s,warmest decade since Singapore began local,temperature recordings in 1929. In 2021, Singapore,also experienced record rainfalls in January, April,and August, leading to flash floods in various parts,of Singapore. Sea levels around the island rose by,14 cm from 1979 to 2019.,Even with international efforts to limit the rise in,global temperatures, there is a need to prepare,Singapore for the impacts of climate change. Some,adaptation measures require longer lead times,to implement and have to be undertaken early.,Adaptation plans must also be adaptive to climate,uncertainties and evolving climate science.,To coordinate such efforts, a multi-agency,Resilience Working Group (RWG), led by the,Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment,(MSE) and the Ministry of National Development,(MND), was set up in 2010 under the IMCCC. The,RWG assesses Singapore’s physical vulnerabilities,to climate change based on a Resilience,Framework, which guides the formulation of,adaptation plans up to 2100 (see the next page for,Singapore’s Resilience Framework),The RWG comprises 20 agencies which oversee,key sectoral risks and efforts in enhancing,Singapore’s adaptive capacity, strengthening,resilience capabilities, and reducing vulnerability,to climate change. The inter-agency effort ensures,that adaptation plans are coordinated across the,Government. The agencies involved are:,○ Building and Construction Authority (BCA);,○ Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS);,○ Centre for Liveable Cities (CLC);,○ Energy Market Authority (EMA);,○ Housing & Development Board (HDB);,○ Info-comm Media Development Authority,(IMDA);,○ JTC Corporation (JTC);,○ Land Transport Authority (LTA);,○ Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore,(MPA);,○ Ministry of Finance (MOF);,○ Ministry of Health (MOH);,○ Ministry of National Development (MND);,○ Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment,(MSE);,○ National Environment Agency (NEA);,○ National Parks Board (NParks);,○ Prime Minister’s Office - Strategy Group,,National Climate Change Secretariat,(PMO-SG/NCCS);,○ PUB, Singapore’s National Water Agency;,○ Singapore Food Agency (SFA);,○ Singapore Land Authority (SLA); and,○ Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA),RWG has identified six key adaptation risk areas,for Singapore.,\n",

      "Text: ,The window for decisive international action,on climate change is narrowing. The recently,completed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate,Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report (AR6),cycle concluded that the effects of climate change,are widespread, rapid and intensifying.,As a low-lying island city-state, climate change,is an existential threat for Singapore. While,we account for only 0.1% of global emissions,,Singapore has taken important steps to contribute,to the global effort to tackle climate change and is,continually working to overcome our constraints to,raise our climate ambition.,At the Copenhagen Conference in 2009, Singapore,pledged to reduce emissions by 16% below our,business-as-usual (BAU) level in 2020. We are,happy to announce that Singapore has achieved,this target. This was achieved through sustained,efforts in improving energy efficiency across,various sectors of our economy, including an,early switch from fuel oil to natural gas for power,generation, among many other environmentally,friendly measures. Yet, more work needs to be,done. According to AR6 by the IPCC, the world,needs to achieve net zero by around 2050 in order,to limit global warming to 1.5 °C.,In October 2022, Singapore announced that it,will enhance its climate pledge by committing to,achieve net zero emissions by 2050, contingent on,technological maturity and effective international,cooperation. Our ability to fulfil our pledges, like all,Parties, will depend on the continued international,commitment by Parties to the Paris Agreement and,their climate pledges.,We also announced that we will enhance our,2030 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC),to reduce emissions to around 60 MtCO2e in,2030 after peaking emissions earlier. With this,enhanced ambition, we have further aligned,our long-term emissions trajectory with the,Paris Agreement.,This is a significant and ambitious commitment,for Singapore, a country that has limited potential,for alternative energy sources. Our climate,commitments are backed by concrete strategies,,policies and actions, starting from this current,crucial decade. A key measure we are taking is,to raise our domestic carbon tax progressively,from the current S$5 per tonne to around S$50 to,S$80 per tonne 3 by 2030. We have also launched a,comprehensive Singapore Green Plan 2030 (Green,Plan), to make a collective whole-of-nation effort,to achieve our sustainability and climate goals. The,Green Plan is a living plan which will continue to,evolve as technology develops and we review our,strategies over time.,Singapore’s decisive shift to net zero will require,significant transformation in all aspects of daily life,,economy, and society. There will be costs to bear,and trade-offs to be made. At the same time, it will,reposition Singapore and bring about a cleaner,,greener world for our future generations.,Singapore’s Fifth National Communication –,which includes our first Adaptation Communication,– and Fifth Biennial Update Report highlight the,measures that we have taken as a nation to address,climate change and our commitment to meet our,2020 emissions reduction pledge,Singapore continues to build on a long-standing,,comprehensive national approach that seeks,to achieve sustainable growth alongside,environmental protection. This has allowed us,to limit our growth in emissions and stay on,track to achieve our international commitments,,notwithstanding our geographical constraints.,National Circumstances,Singapore is a small, low-lying, island city-state,vulnerable to the effects of climate change.,With a total land area (including that of smaller,surrounding islands) of about 733.1 km2,,Singapore’s population density of about 7,485,persons per km2 is one of the highest in the world.,Due to Singapore’s small size and dense urban,landscape, there are challenges to using alternative,energy sources such as solar, nuclear and wind,energy. These difficulties in transitioning to,alternative energy sources are recognised by the,UNFCCC. Solar remains the most viable source,of renewable energy in Singapore, and we aim,to accelerate the deployment of solar energy,despite challenges arising from our national,circumstances.,Institutional Arrangements,Climate change is an issue with many dimensions,that cut across the responsibilities of several,ministries. The IMCCC, chaired by Mr Teo Chee,Hean, Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister,for National Security, oversees the whole-of-,government (WOG) coordination on climate,change policies. The National Climate Change,Secretariat (NCCS) is a dedicated unit under the,Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) Strategy Group that,serves as the secretariat to the IMCCC.,Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Inventory,Singapore’s GHG emissions for 2018 totalled,53,312.68 gigagram (Gg) CO2 equivalent. Carbon,dioxide (CO2) accounted for 94.3% of total,EXECUTIVE SUMMARY,emissions. Non-CO2 gases such as methane,(CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), perfluorocarbons,(PFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), sulphur,hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrogen trifluoride,(NF3) accounted for the remaining 5.7% of,total emissions. This excludes an estimate of,HFCs emissions from the refrigeration and air,conditioning (RAC) sector, for which we are in the,process of finalising.,Mitigation Measures,Singapore has achieved our Copenhagen pledge,to reduce our emissions by 16% below our BAU,level in 2020.,A key pillar of Singapore’s strategy to mitigate,GHG emissions is to improve energy efficiency,across different sectors of the economy.,Singapore does not subsidise energy costs,,and has taken steps to use a cleaner fuel mix for,electricity generation, switching from fuel oil to,natural gas. However, there are limits to how much,more emissions can be reduced by switching,fuels, as natural gas, the cleanest fossil fuel,,already constitutes about 95% of our fuel mix for,electricity generation. To further decarbonise the,power sector, we will harness and tap on the “Four,Switches”: natural gas, solar, regional power grids,,and emerging low-carbon technologies.,Singapore will continue to push ahead with,mitigation efforts in the different sectors as part,of the Green Plan, which is a whole-of-nation,movement to advance Singapore’s national,agenda on sustainable development.,In addition, Singapore has implemented a carbon,tax of S$5 or US$3.70 per tonne of CO2 equivalent,(tCO2 eq) of GHG emissions in the first instance,,between 2019 and 2023, as a transition period.,The carbon tax will be increased to S$25 or,US$18.40/tCO2 eq in 2024 and 2025, and S$45 or,US$33.20/tCO2 eq in 2026 and 2027, with a view to,reaching S$50–80 or US$36.90–59.00/tCO2 eq by,2030. The carbon tax will complement our existing,mitigation efforts to meet our climate pledge under,the Paris Agreement.,Vulnerability and Adaptation Measures,As a relatively low-lying, densely populated island,in the tropics, Singapore is naturally vulnerable to,the impacts of climate change. Singapore takes,a proactive, long-term approach towards climate,change adaptation. Climate change resilience goes,beyond physical adaptation, and must include,building resilient mindsets as well as collective,action to safeguard our environment. Additionally,,our trade-dependent economy increases our,exposure and vulnerability to the volatilities,induced by climate change. Climate resilience and,adaptation plans will be continuously reviewed and,adjusted as new knowledge and information on the,effects of climate change become available.,Concluding Remarks,Singapore remains committed to doing our part,in this global crisis. We will advance on this,sustainability journey together as a nation, making,a decisive move to achieve net zero by 2050 and,at the same time building up our climate resilience,and adaptation. As a responsible member of the,global community, Singapore will continue to work,at the international, regional and bilateral levels,to support collective global efforts to address the,challenges of climate change.,\n",

      "Text: ,Saudi Arabia is an arid country characterized by low rainfall, high temperatures and limited,water resources. There are no perennial rivers in the country. The main water resources in the,country are surface water runoff, shallow and deep groundwater, desalinated seawater and,wastewater. surface water is limited to rainfall runoff flowing through valleys. Saudi Arabia,consists of a variety of habitats which includes deserts, plains, plateaus, mountains and lava,flows. The three major bodies of sand in the Kingdom are the Great Nafud in the north, the,Empty Quarter in the south and Ad-Dahna; a crescent-shaped body of sand connecting Nafud,and Rub Al-Khali deserts.,The Kingdom is one of the world's largest oil exporters, with a single-source economy heavily,reliant on oil income. The Kingdom's primary development agenda, the Saudi Vision 2030,,was announced in 2016. This development strategy serves as the main vehicle for diversifying,the Kingdom's economy away from reliance on a single source of revenue. For the realization,and achievement of the 96 strategic objectives of Saudi Vision 2030, 13 Vision Realization,Programs (VRPs) have been established by the Council of Economic and Development Affairs,(CEDA). The VRPs aim to develop a diversified economy encompassing all sectors to ensure,homogeneous development. The Financial Sector Development Program has the goal of,advancing the financial sector of the Kingdom through support provided to the private sector,,formation of a state-of-the-art capital market and enabling the diversification of the sources of,income and investment. The National Transformation Program (NTP) intends to improve,living standards for all in the Kingdom through increasing the ease of access to healthcare and,promoting a sustainable approach towards national resources such as food security and access,to water. The National Companies Promotion Program is dedicated to promoting 100+ local,and regional companies to become global leaders, thereby displaying the economic strength of,the Kingdom on the global platform. Through the Fiscal Balance Program, the Kingdom is,pursuing its goals of maximizing oil and non-oil revenues through improved efficiency and,risk management and mitigation strategies. VRPs are essential to realizing the objectives of,Saudi Vision 2030 and ensuring that the Kingdom stays firm upon its path to sustainable,development and diversification of its economy. An impressive progress has been reflected for,different programs under the Vision Realization Programs in the Vision progress report for the,period 2016-2020.,Saudi Vision 2030 provides a roadmap towards achieving sustainable development through,social and economic reforms. The roadmap focuses on the development of service sectors like,health, education, infrastructure and tourism and therefore increasing employment,opportunities and diversifying the economy. Furthermore, despite the major health and,economic crisis arising owing to the novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID 19), the Kingdom,is committed to its economic diversification initiatives with the continued sustainable,development agenda. The Kingdom has embarked upon the mega projects namely NEOM,,AMAALA, AL-ULA, Qiddiya, Red Sea Project and Prince Mohammad bin Salman Nature,Reserve.,Saudi Arabia, due to its arid environment and sensitive ecosystem is vulnerable to bio-physical,impacts of climate change. The socioeconomic impacts of climate change response measures by other countries also make Saudi Arabia vulnerable to climate change due to its reliance,mainly on single source.,Saudi Arabia has launched two green initiatives in 2021 namely Saudi Green Initiative (SGI),and Middle East Green Initiative (MGI) under the patronage of HRH Prince Mohammed bin,Salman bin Abdulaziz, the Crown Prince, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Defense and,Chairman of the Saudi Council of Economic and Development Affairs.,The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia submitted its Updated Nationally Determined Contribution,(NDC) to the UNFCCC Secretariat in October 2021. The updated NDC is aimed to remove,,avoid and reduce GHG emissions by 278 million tons of CO2 eq by 2030 which is more than,two-fold increase compared to the Kingdom’s previous INDC submitted in November 2015.,The updated NDC show a progression and highest possible ambition. These NDC are based on,the principles listed in Article 3 of UNFCCC and Articles 4.1, 4.7 and 4.15 of the Paris,Agreement and Conference of Parties Decisions 1/CP.19, 1CP.20, 1/CP.21 and 1/CP.24 and,the approach specified in the economic diversification initiative adopted as the Conference of,Parties Decision 24/CP.18 in 2012 in Doha.,The Saudi Arabian NDC are based on the Dynamic baseline approach, taking into,consideration country’s national circumstances.,The dynamic baseline scenarios are based on the ability of the Kingdom to grow and diversify,its economy, keeping in mind that the Kingdom is not seeking financial support towards,achieving its NDC. The achievement of NDC is also incumbent upon sustainable economic,growth and diversification of the Kingdom’s economy, while preserving Kingdom’s leading,role in promoting security and stability of global energy markets. The Kingdom will use the,best suited technologies to achieve its NDC using Circular Carbon Economy (CCE) approach.,The Saudi Green Initiative (SGI) is a multidimensional initiative which contributes towards,achieving the climate ambitions of the Kingdom. The SGI roadmap consisted of over 60,initiatives. The roadmap includes reducing carbon emissions by implementing energy,efficiency programs, developing carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) technology,,increasing public transportation and increasing renewable energy capacity. The five initiatives,which will help the Kingdom achieve its NDC under SGI are; enhance SEEP by 2025, use,captured carbon to produce chemicals and synthetic fuels by 2030, changing the energy mix,towards a more sustainable one by 2030, become the world’s leading hydrogen producer and,exporter by 2030 and waste management transformation in Riyadh by 2035. The other,initiatives under SGI are green Saudi Arabia initiative by planting 450 million trees all over,the Kingdom by 2030 and protecting land and sea by increasing the terrestrial and marine,protected areas to 20% of the Kingdom’s total area by 2030.,Saudi Arabia also announced the Middle East Green Initiative (MGI), a regional initiative to,lead and support regional efforts to achieve global climate ambitions, with a focus on actions,and cooperation to accomplish climate aspirations. These initiatives include:,(i) Encourage GCC and Middle Eastern countries to implement circular carbon economy,projects and activities to boost the usage of clean energy and reduce greenhouse gas,emissions in the region.,(ii) Establish a regional center for Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (CCUS) in,Arabian Gulf States (GCC countries and Iraq).,(iii) Support and facilitate access to clean energy for cooking in the middle east regions and,raising the health and lifespan of clean fuel users specially women and children and,reduce the GHG emissions.,(iv) Clean Oceans and Rivers Initiative by participating in the cleanup of oceans and rivers,of plastic waste in the middle east region.,The Kingdom is providing leadership in the area of circular carbon economy as a vehicle for,implementing its updated nationally determined contribution. Saudi Arabia adopted the,concept of the circular carbon economy as the framework for its climate policy. The CCE,embraces a technology-neutral approach that caters for all possible solutions without prejudice,to, or predisposition against, any single option. Circular carbon economy involves a stepwise,closure of the carbon cycle via utilization or conversion of CO2 generated from the combustion,of fossil fuels leading to significant reduction of carbon emissions. The CCE is based on four,R’s; reduce, reuse, recycle and remove for the management of carbon in the CCE. Within the,framework of circular carbon economy, three types of carbon have been identified namely the,‘Living Carbon’ which resides in the biosphere and it naturally balances with the atmosphere,and is the basis of life. The second is the ‘Durable Carbon’ which resides in the techno-sphere,and is used in a range of applications, from long-term infrastructure to recycled plastics. The,third is the Fugitive Carbon’ which is released into the environment as excess anthropogenic,carbon dioxide in the atmosphere or as plastics in the ocean. All the 4Rs of the circular carbon,economy serve to minimize fugitive carbon.,This report, the Fourth National Communication (NC4) of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has,been prepared by the Designated National Authority (DNA) in close cooperation and,coordination of relevant sector ministries, entities and other stakeholders. The report is,comprised of ten (10) sections namely:,(i) National Circumstances,(ii) 2016 National Inventory of Anthropogenic Emissions by Sources and Removals by,Sinks of Greenhouse Gases Not Controlled by the Montreal Protocol,(iii) Steps Taken to Address Article 12.1(b) of United Nations Framework Convention on,Climate Change (UNFCCC) - Role of Economic Diversification to Address Climate,Change Issues in Saudi Arabia,(iv) Analysis of Socioeconomic Impacts of Response Measures,(v) Vulnerability Assessment & Adaptation: Impact Analysis of Climate Change on Water,Resources and Identification and Appraisal of Appropriate Adaptation Measures,(vi) Vulnerability Assessment & Adaptation: Impact Analysis of Climate Change on,Coastal and Marine Ecosystem and Identification and Appraisal of Appropriate,Adaptation Measures,(vii) Vulnerability Assessment & Adaptation: Impact Analysis of Climate Change on,Desertification and Identification and Appraisal of Appropriate Adaptation Measures,(viii) Vulnerability Assessment & Adaptation: Impact Analysis of Climate Change on,Agriculture and Identification and Appraisal of Appropriate Adaptation Measures,(ix) Climate Change Research, Education, Training, Capacity Building and Public,Awareness,(x) Constraints and gaps and related financial, technical and capacity-building needs,\n",
