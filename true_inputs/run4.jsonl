Section 1: National Circumstances
1.1 Location, Topography and Climate
1.1.1 Location
Located in the furthermost part of southwest Asia at a latitude of 16.5°N - 32.5°N and a
longitude of 33.75°E - 56.25°E, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia encompasses a total area of
approximately 2.25 million square kilometers and occupies about four-fifth of the Arabian
Peninsula. The Kingdom is surrounded on the north by Jordan, Iraq and Kuwait; on the south
by Sultanate of Oman and Yemen; on the west by Red Sea and on the east by the Arabia Gulf,
Bahrain, Qatar and United Arab Emirates.
1.1.2 Topography
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is home to a diversity of habitats and embodies five prominent
landforms; desert, plain, plateau, mountains and lava flows in addition to terrain features such
as valleys, meadows and salt-pans. The Kingdom accommodates four major bodies of sand
namely Ar-Rub’ Al Khali (Empty Quarter), the world’s largest continuous sand desert in the
south, the Great Nafud in the north, Al Jafurah Desert which lies south of the Gulf of Bahrain,
and the crescent-shaped body of sand Ad-Dahna which links Ar Rub’ Al Khali to the Great
Nafud through its north-south corridor. Additionally, there are several prominent bodies of
sand along the side of Tuwayq escarpment and two smaller sand seas namely Ramlat As-
Sab’atayn and the Ramlat Al Wahıbah (Wahiba Sands).
Sand bodies of the Arabian Peninsula cover about 30% of the landmass and possess features
which are specific to each body. The lack of oases in the Great Nafud, a very large depression
filled up with masses of red sand covering an area of almost 64,000 square kilometers,
distinguishes it from the narrow, triangular strip of buff sand Al-Jafurah which extends
northwards from the Empty Quarter to east of Hofuf following the coastal plain. While the
plains cover the coastal area, the plateaus envelop the central regions of Saudi Arabia. The
southwestern regions are home to the mountainous terrains whereas the lava flows span across
the west and northwestern regions of the Kingdom.
From a geological outlook, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is divided into two recognizable
groups of rocky habitats; the Arabian Shield and Arabian Shelf. Spreading across one-third of
the Arabian Peninsula, the Arabian Shield is formed of crystalline and metamorphic rocks of
Precambrian age uplifted on the entire western sides with volcanic lava flows of tertiary-
quaternary age and appears unevenly along the southern coast. Groundwater transpires within
valley deposits and a handful of sub-basaltic deposits. On the contrary, the Arabian Shelf
envelops two thirds of the surface area of the Kingdom and is composed of a thick sequence of
unaltered, younger sedimentary formations ranging in age from Cambrian to recent.
1.1.3 Climate
Alterations in the climatic conditions of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia are present due its
inherently varied topographical features. Temperature alterations are the most apparent
amongst interior and coastal regions. During the summers, inland temperatures vary seasonally
ranging from 27°C - 45°C while the coastal areas record a range between 27°C - 38°C even
though summers are hot and dry in the interior regions while the coastal areas experience humid
summers. The winters are cold in the inland regions with 8°C - 20°C temperatures and mild in
the coastal areas with temperatures 19°C - 29°C (TNC, KSA, 2016). The temperatures in the
winter were recorded as low as 2.7°C (min) in Turaif and Guriat and 22.9°C (max) in Jazan in
the month of January 2019. In 2019, the maximum temperature range recorded was 31.2°C in
Jazan in July and 46.4°C in Al-Ahsa in June. The average humidity range recorded in 2019
was 10% (Madinah and Riyadh in June) and 88% (Arar in January) in different parts of the
Kingdom (GASTAT, 2019).
The minimum and maximum temperature varied widely from region to region. The average
annual temperature ranges from 11.8°C to 34.5°C in different regions. The monthly averages
of minimum and maximum temperatures for different regions are presented in Tables 5.3 and
5.4 respectively in section 5 of this report. These tables show that the maximum and minimum
temperature increased gradually from January to the peak values in July and/or August and
then decrease gradually till December. The minimum temperature was in the range of 2.6°C in
January to 31.6°C in July in the Kingdom while the maximum temperature was in the range of
14.3°C in January to 46.4°C in July. (Tarawneh and Chowdhury, 2018; FAO, 2020; GASTAT
2019).
Although average rainfall across the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 2019 was recorded at 55 mm
while in 2018, it was 87 mm (MEWA, 2019), variance is observed regionally with regards to
precipitation trends. In the northern regions, rainfall ranges from minimal in the summer
months to a maximum in the winters. In the central regions, rainfall occurs mostly in the winter
months. In the Eastern Regions, similar trends are observed with almost no precipitation in the
summer months and more focused in the months of October and November. The southwestern
regions experience relatively heavier rainfalls overall but mostly concentrated within the winter
months. The southern regions are the scarcest in the context of precipitation throughout the
year (GASTAT, 2018). In 2019, the minimum rainfall recorded was 26.1 mm in Wadi
AlDawasir and maximum 304.4 mm was recorded in Khamis Mushayt. The overall average
rainfall recorded over the Kingdom in 2019 was 95.5 mm (GASTAT, 2019).
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change owing
to the acute and severe climatic conditions. A diverse number of climate models predict
extreme impacts of climate change to the Kingdom’s coastal and marine ecosystems,
desertification, water resources, and agriculture sector as a consequence of increases in average
temperature and decreased rainfall spanning the geography of the Kingdom (Tarawneh and
Chowdhury, 2018). The results of these impacts place further stress on the existing depleted
and remaining limited water resources, giving rise to challenges on the environmental and
economic fronts for the Kingdom.
1.2 Demography and Population Statistics
The total population of Saudi Arabia in 2019 stands at 34.2 million out of which males were
19.7 million and females are 14.5 million. Most of the Saudi population is young within the
age group of 35-39 at around 3.7 million people. The lowest number of people exist in the age
group 75-79 at 172,838. Most of the government’s policies and economic development plans
are focused on improving job opportunities for the Saudi population and catering to meeting
the demands of the growing population while ensuring sustainability of the natural resources
and achieving the objectives laid out in its Saudi Vision 2030 (GASTAT, 2019). Census were
conducted in 1974, 1992, 2004, 2010. The subsequent recorded population during these
censuses were 7 million, 16.9 million, 22.7 million and 27.1 million respectively. The
population survey conducted in 2016 recorded a population of 31.8 million.
The demography of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is comprised of Saudi and Non-Saudi
population. Non-Saudi population makes a significant proportion of Saudi Arabia contributing
to 37.84% of the total population while Saudi population was 62.16%. It has also been observed
that the most densely populated regions in the Kingdom are Makkah and Riyadh both having
a population of around 8.8 and 8.5 million respectively (GASTAT, 2018). Table 1.1 shows the
age group wise distribution of Saudi population while figure 1.2 reflects total population of
Saudi Arabia from 1974 to 2018.
1.3 Directions of Development – Vision 2030, KSA
The government of Saudi Arabia announced “Saudi Vision 2030”, the economic blueprint of
the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in April 2016, with the objective of diversifying the Kingdom’s
economy to become more sustainable and resilient (Guendouz and Ouassaf, 2020; Saudi Vision
2030). Saudi Vision 2030 provides a roadmap towards achieving sustainable development
through social and economic reforms. The roadmap consists of 96 objectives (Saudi Vision
2030) arising from three themes of Saudi Vision 2030 namely; (i) A Vibrant Society; (ii) A
Thriving Economy and (iii) An Ambitious Nation. The roadmap focuses on the development
of service sectors like health, education, infrastructure and tourism resulting in increasing
employment and diversifying the economy. The main goal of Vision 2030 is “to raise the share
of non-oil exports in non-oil GDP from 16% to 50%” (Saudi Vision 2030). Furthermore,
despite the major health and economic crisis arising owing to the novel coronavirus pandemic,
the Kingdom is committed to its economic diversification initiatives with the continued
development agenda. The Kingdom has embarked upon the mega projects namely NEOM,
AMAALA, AL-ULA, Qiddiya, Red Sea Project and Prince Mohammad bin Salman Nature
Reserve (Tricaud, 2020).
1.3.1 Vision Realization Programs (VRPs)
For the realization and achievement of the 96 strategic objectives of Vision 2030, 13 Vision
Realization Programs (VRPs) have been established by the Council of Economic and
Development Affairs (CEDA) (Saudi Vision 2030) which are as follows:
• Quality of Life Program
• Financial Sector Development Program
• Housing Program
• Fiscal Balance Program
• National Transformation Program
• Public Investment Fund Program
• Privatization Program
• National Companies Promotion Program
• National Industrial Development and Logistics Program
• Strategic Partnership Program
• Doyof Al Rahman Program (Hajj and Omrah Program)
• Human Capital Development Program
• National Character Enrichment Program
The VRPs are aimed to develop a diversified economy encompassing all sectors to ensure
homogeneous development. The Financial Sector Development Program has the goal of
advancing the financial sector of the Kingdom through support provided to the private sector,
formation of a state-of-the-art capital market and enabling the diversification of the sources of
income and investment. The National Transformation Program (NTP) intends to improve
living standards for all in the Kingdom through increasing the ease of access to healthcare and
promoting a sustainable approach towards national resources such as food security and access
to water. The National Companies Promotion Program is dedicated to promoting 100+ local
and regional companies to become global leaders, thereby displaying the economic strength of
the Kingdom on the global platform. Through the Fiscal Balance Program, the Kingdom is
pursuing its goals of maximizing oil and non-oil revenues through improved efficiency and
risk management and mitigation strategies. VRPs are essential to realizing the objectives of
Saudi Vision 2030, KSA and ensuring that the Kingdom stays firm upon its path to sustainable
development and diversification of its economy.
A Vision progress reports for the year 2017-1018 has shown an impressive progress for
different programs under the Vision Realization Programs.
1.4 Education
Education is the main pillar of human development and has expanded steadily since the start
of the Kingdom’s First Development Plan in 1970 due to the sustained support and attention
given to education sector by the government. The government of the Kingdom has devoted
significant resources to the development of human resources and manpower skills. Government
has therefore taken concerted measures in its successive national development planning
processes to address its goal of enhancing educational achievement at all levels giving the
Ministry of Education the role of supervising all general education; and emphasizing the
effective implementation of educational strategies. Another equally important measure has
been to enhance the role of the private sector in the planning and provision of educational
facilities. However, the public sector remains the main provider of educational services, with
a share of 84.2 percent of the total enrolment in all stages of public schooling across primary,
intermediate and secondary education in 2018 (GASTAT, 2018). As part of Saudi Vision 2030,
the continuous education program aims to eradicate illiteracy within the Kingdom as the
literacy rate currently sits at 95% as of 2017.
Moreover, the 13th Goal of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, called for
amongst others, the “improvement of education, awareness-raising, human and institutional
capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning”.
Training and capacity building are central to the climate change awareness process and thus
requires collaborative efforts from all stakeholders. Saudi Vision 2030 also aims to provide
opportunity for both men and women in the field of education in Saudi Arabia. Currently there
is an increasing trend in the total number of higher education graduates with around 55% of
which are females. Figures 1.3 and 1.4 show total number of higher education graduates and
number of “Males and Females” higher education graduates respectively. (GASTAT 2018)
1.5 Health
Saudi Arabia has a well-developed National Health Care System in which the government
provides free health care services through a number of government agencies. Saudi Arabia
has been ranked 26th best country in providing high quality healthcare (WHO, 2000; Best
Healthcare in the World, 2022).
Healthcare is one of the main focus areas of the ambitious Saudi Vision 2030 and National
Transformation Program 2020 (NTP) that seeks to further improve the quality of healthcare
services and facilities across the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The allocated budget by the
government for health and social development was Saudi Riyal (SAR) 146.5 billion in 2018,
15% of the total budgetary expenditure (SAMA, 2018) while it was increased to Saudi Riyal
(SAR) 175 billion in 2021.
Hospitals and healthcare services in the Kingdom have been on an increasing trend since the
past four decades. The majority of hospitals are owned and run by the Ministry of Health, while
the share of the private sector has also been increasing steadily. Hospitals in Saudi Arabia in
1440H (2018-2019) equaled to a total of 498 Hospitals (334 Government Hospitals and 164
Private Sector Hospitals). Figure 1.6 shows the trend and number of hospitals owned and
operated by different sectors in the Kingdom.
1.6 Energy Profile
1.6.1 Oil and Gas
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia had 267.07 billion Barrels of proven Crude Oil reserves and
49,202 billion cubic meters (BCM) of proven Natural Gas reserves in 2019. The Kingdom
produced around 9.8 million barrels of Oil per day in 2019 and 1.32 million barrels of Natural
Gas Liquids per day in 2019 (SAMA’s annual statistics 2019).
The Kingdom produced around 924.942 million Barrel of refined products in 2019 and
1,028.298 million Barrel of refined products in 2018 (SAMA’s annual statistics 2019). The
Kingdom exported around 2,568.90 million barrels of Crude Oil and 474.41 million barrels of
refined products in 2019. The Kingdom consumed around 1,566.118 million Barrel of refined
products, Crude Oil and Natural Gas domestically (SAMA’s annual statistics 2019).
1.6.2 Electricity
The Kingdom has 83 power plants with a total generating capacity of 85,185 MW. Out of
85,185 MW generating capacity, Saudi Electricity Company (SEC) contributes 65%, Saline
Water Conversion Corporation (SWCC) contributes 7.6%, Marafiq 2.4%, Independent Water
and Power Producers (IWPPs) 16.5%, others 7.7% and renewable energy contribution was
0.5% (ECRA statistical book, 2019). In 2019, the percent contribution of different types of
power generation technologies were 34.7% by gas turbines, 44.7% by steam turbines, 0.5%
each by diesel generators and renewables. The installation of energy efficient combined cycle
power plants has been increasing steadily in the Kingdom.
In 2019, the Kingdom’s electricity consumption was around 289 TWh with 44.5% of the
consumption by residential category. In 2019, the Kingdom had licensed capacity of 424 MW
from Renewable Energy (ECRA statistical book, 2019).
1.7 Industrial and Economic Development
1.7.1 Industrial and Economic Cities
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has been developing a number of industrial zones and economic
cities to achieve economic development and diversification of the economy, increase
competitiveness and attract investors. These industrial cities and economic zones include:
1.7.1.1 Industrial Cities
1.7.1.1.1 Saudi Authority for Industrial Cities and Technology Zones (MODON)
Saudi Arabia established the first three Industrial cities in the cities of Jeddah, Riyadh and
Dammam in 1973. The number of industrial cities increased to 12 in 1993. The Saudi Authority
for Industrial Cities and Technology Zones (MODON) was established in 2001 to manage these
industrial cities. The number of industrial cities across the Kingdom managed by MODON is
currently 35. These industrial cities generally have small and medium scale industries such as:
food products, beverages, textile, furniture, base metal, electrical equipment, machinery,
equipment, computers, motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers, electronic and optical
products, pharmaceutical industries, wood and wood products, chemicals and its products,
paper and its products, rubber and plastic-products, building materials, ceramics and glass,
printing etc. (MODON 2021)
1.7.1.1.2 Royal Commission for Jubail and Yanbu (RCJY)
Established in 1975, the Royal Commission for Jubail and Yanbu (RCJY) plans, promotes,
develops and manages petrochemical and energy intensive industrial cities. These cities are
located in Jubail and Yanbu. The RCJY has been additionally tasked to develop and manage
mining industries in Ras Al-Khair as well as creating future expansion plans with partners to
establish a city for mining industries.
RCJY in the industrial cities of Yanbu on the western coast and Jubail on the eastern coast of
Saudi Arabia having industrial complex of primary industries from petrochemical plants to oil
refineries and power and desalination plants and the industrial ports. The industrial cities of
Jubail and Yanbu are currently undergoing the second phase of development.
1.7.1.2 Economic Cities

JEC targets sectors such as Petroleum refineries, Petrochemical industries, mining industries,
heavy industries, food processing and packaging and other strategic sectors. A multi-purpose
seaport will be built in the city
1.8 Water Resources
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is one of the world’s most water scarce country with an average
rainfall of approximately 100-150 mm/year. There are no perennial rivers in the country. The
hot and dry weather during summers with high temperatures soaring around 45°C in some areas
further aggravates the situation. As mentioned above, the rainfall is low and vary across the
country.
The Kingdom’s water resources are categorized into the following four categories; surface
water, groundwater, desalinated water and reclaimed wastewater which are discussed below.
1.8.1 Surface Water
The total estimated runoff as a result of the precipitation in 2018 and 2019 in different parts of
the Kingdom was 6,746 MCM and 4,179 MCM respectively. The total amount of water runoff
collected in the dams in 2018 was 1,200 MCM and 970 MCM in 2019 (MEWA, 2019). Saudi
Arabia has completed the construction of a total of 522 dams in different parts of the country
by 2019 while the number of dams in 2018 and 2017 was 512 and 507 with capacities of 2,304
MCM and 2,270 MCM and 2,265 MCM respectively. The number of dams in 2014 was 482
dams across the Kingdom to store an estimated 2,084 MCM of the surface water runoff (Saudi
Arabia BUR1, 2018). These dams facilitate storage of surface water runoff, prevent flash
floods, reduce surface water evaporation and increase infiltration to recharge shallow aquifers,
in addition to irrigation and for storing water for drinking purposes (AlTokhais, 2018, Saudi
Arabia BUR1, 2018).
In addition, a total of 8,611 water wells including 3,938 potable water tube wells, 3,336 manual
potable water wells, 909 monitoring wells and 528 test wells also existed in 2019 (MEWA,
2019). MEWA also has planned to construct additional 369 wells in 39 areas of the Kingdom
with a total water production of 927,804 cubic meter/day by 2020 as part of National
Transformation Programme 2020. (MEWA, 2019).
1.8.2 Groundwater
Groundwater sources in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia are divided into two categories; shallow
aquifers and deep aquifers. The shallow aquifers are constituted within alluvium soil while the
deep aquifers are formed within sandstone and limestone sediments which stretch across
thousands of square kilometers. These deep rock aquifers have inadequate natural recharge and
are therefore regarded as non-renewable resource of water formed over thousands of years ago
(MoWA, 1984). These aquifers are further divided into principal and secondary aquifers. The
principal aquifers are depicted in the figure 1.7.
1.8.3 Desalinated Water
As the world’s largest producer of desalinated water, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has been
constantly striving to meet the growing demand for potable water due to increasing population
by increasing the amount of desalinated water production. The amount of desalinated water
produced in 2018 was 2,541 MCM and as Figure 1.8 below indicates, the amount has been
increasing annually since the amount of desalinated water produced was below 1,500 MCM in
2010 (SWCC, 2011). 65% of the Urban sector’s water demand is met through the utilization
of desalinated water and 35% through groundwater (MEWA, 2019).
Seawater desalination is carried out using a number of technologies. Important among them
and used in Saudi Arabia are Multi-Stage Flash (MSF), Multi-effect Distillation (MED), and
Reverse Osmosis (RO). In 2019, 32% of the desalinated water was produced by RO, 54% by
MSF and 14% by MED (Figure 1.9). Consistent with the increase in the number of desalination
plants and water production, the capacity of electricity produced by these desalination plants
has also increased simultaneously (ECRA, 2019). The total number of desalination plants as of
2019 was 51 with a total capacity of around 7,765,048 m 3 /day. The share of desalinated water
produced on the eastern coast (Arabian Gulf) in 2019 was 53% and on the western coast (Red
Sea) was 47% (Figure 1.9)
1.8.4 Reclaimed Wastewater
The number of sewage treatment plants in the country in 2019 was 99 (MEWA, 2019) treating
a total of 1.802 BCM of municipal wastewater. As of 2019, 17.2% of the treated wastewater
was reused (MEWA, 2019) and remaining treated wastewater is disposed off either into the
marine environment (Arabian Gulf or the Red Sea) or on land generally in the valleys (wadis).
The National Water Company (NWC) under MEWA is responsible for collecting, treating,
recycling and reuse of the municipal wastewater in the Kingdom.
1.8.5 Water Demand by Different Sectors
The total water demand in the Kingdom is comprised of Urban, Industrial, and Agricultural
sectors. The water demand is depicted in Table 1.2 below
The above data suggests the agriculture sector is the most significant sector consuming 72% of
the renewable and non-renewable groundwater within the Kingdom to meet its requirements
while urban sector consumes 20% and industrial sector consumes only 8% of the total water
consumption. (MEWA, 2019). Considering the significant role water has to play across the
economy, the Ministry of Environment, Water, and Agriculture (MEWA) has taken steps to
address potential areas within the water system which can reduce the water wastage,
consumption and demand, subsequently contributing to improving efficiency of the water
systems.
1.8.6 National Water Strategy
The Ministry of Environment, Water, and Agriculture (MEWA) has developed the National
Water Strategy 2030 (2018-2030) aimed at; “A sustainable water sector, safeguarding the
natural resources and the environment of the Kingdom and providing cost-effective supply and
high-quality services”. In the National Water Strategy, MEWA endeavors to meet continuous
water demand while also storing enough water for emergency situations, provide affordable
high-quality water while ensuring sustainable utilization of the Kingdom’s limited water
resources and preservation of the environment. It also strives to encourage private sector
participation in order to ensure a positive contribution of the water sector in the country’s
economy. In order to achieve its objectives, MEWA has outlined 10 strategic programs with
subsequent initiatives (MEWA, 2019).
(i) The quantitative targets set by MEWA are to reduce water demand and consumption
from 24.8 BCM/year to 12.5 BCM/year in 2030, most of which will be achieved through
reduction in the agricultural sector from 21.2 BCM (2016 levels) to 11.4 BCM in 2030.
(ii) Another objective is to preserve the non-renewable groundwater sources by an estimated
reduction in consumption from 20.6 BCM in 2016 to 8.8 BCM in the year 2030 through
the effective and improved utilization of Integrated Water Management. As a result of
the efforts, additionally MEWA aims to create 70,000 indirect and direct jobs by 2030
(MEWA, 2019).
(iii) A national program entitled “Qatrah”, (the droplet), has been announced to rationalize
water consumption in the Kingdom. The program has set ambitious targets to reduce the
potable water consumption by around 43 percent by 2030 (NWC, 2019).
1.9 Tourism
The tourism sector in Saudi Arabia is considered to be one of the important sectors for
successful and sustainable growth while focusing on the economic diversification objectives
of the Saudi Vision 2030. The tourism industry is immensely supported by the government
because of its potential to create job opportunities.
In 2011, 17.5 million international tourists visited Saudi Arabia while domestic tourists
accounted for 22.5 million of the total number of tourists (Tourism Information and Research
Center, 2012). These numbers have grown significantly to around 61.8 million for domestic
tourists and 23.7 million for international tourists in the space of seven years (GASTAT, 2019).
The number of jobs generated as a direct result of the tourism sector are 552,556 and recently,
a report by the World Economic Forum ranked the Kingdom 69 on a Tourism Competitiveness
Index (Tourism Information and Research Center, 2012). Historically, the holy sites of Makkah
and Madinah have been the pillar of the tourism industry, but more recently, new cities,
festivals and heritage sites have been attracting domestic tourists and contributing positively to
the national economy through promoting investment in the industry and creating jobs for the
Saudi youth. The historic city of Jeddah, considered as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, AlUla,
home to Hegra which is also a UNESCO World Heritage site, Abha and others have varying
landscapes, beautiful seasons and oases.
The prioritization of the Saudi Arabian government of many megaprojects underscores its
commitment to providing innumerable tourism destinations to attract local and foreign tourists.
Larger megaprojects like Neom and Red Sea projects planned to be completed between 2025
and 2031 as part of destinations to attract tourists are expected to drive home significant foreign
direct investment and create tens of thousands of jobs for Saudis across different sectors such
as tourism, entertainment and construction. With new projects like new hotels and international
airport in Tabuk (Amaala project), entertainment city (Red Sea project), world’s tallest
building, Jeddah Tower (Jeddah Economic City project), etc. planned for construction.

1.10 Coastal and Marine Ecosystem
Saudi Arabia has two coastlines (i) the Red Sea coastline which is approximately 1,760 km
long on the west and (ii) 650 km long Arabian Gulf coastline on the east. Coral Reefs represent
the most significant habitat found along the Saudi shores (both Red Sea & Arabian Gulf). These
reefs approximately 1,480 sq. km form the basic framework of tropical habitats and provide
shelter and food for wide array of marine life. Mangrove forests which cover nearly 35 sq. km.
area are another important habitat particularly in the Red Sea.
The Red Sea coast, where the upward tilt is greatest, is often bold and mountainous, with peaks
of 3,000 meters. Along the Red Sea coast, there is a narrow coastal strip (Tihama) which
broadens out in the Jeddah area and provides access through the highlands to the interior. On
the Eastern side of the Kingdom, the Arabian Gulf coast is flat and low-lying. The shallow seas
in this region deposited layers of younger sedimentary rock, allowing the creation of the vast
oil reserves for which the area is famous. The coast is fringed with extensive coral reefs which
make it difficult to approach the shore in many places.
More than 194 species of coral reefs form about 74 genera have been recorded, with the highest
coral diversity occurring in the central Saudi Arabian Red Sea area. Coral reef harbours a
longstanding and important artisan fishery. Yanbu, Rabigh, Jeddah and Jazan are the main
coastal cities along the Red Sea coastline while Khafji, Jubail, Ras Tanura, Dammam and Al
Khobar are the main cities along the Saudi coast of Arabian Gulf. The cities are densely
populated and have commercial, industrial and agricultural activities.
1.11 Agriculture
Saudi Arabia is a hot and dry country with low precipitation and scarce water resources. The
soils are generally sandy with low fertility. Therefore, use of innovative agriculture
technologies and practices as well as efficient use of water resources is a challenging task.
Sustainable food security is a top priority. With the above-mentioned challenges, Saudi Arabia
has large projects in the field of date palm, poultry, dairy products and aquaculture. Although
Saudi Arabia is a net importer of food items, it also exports surplus products in the field of
dairy, dates, poultry and vegetables (fresh milk 122%, eggs 115% and dates 115%). Agriculture
sector provides 30% of required food for consumption, contributes Saudi Riyals 53 billion
annually that is 3.4% of non-oil GDP and a total workforce of 910,000 (MEWA, 2019).
Saudi Arabia’s agriculture sector is witnessing major changes to meet its pre-set objectives and
achieve sustainable food security in line with Saudi Vision 2030. This is driven by the new
directions to develop the aquaculture, organic farming and green houses in the country. The
recent national development strategy launched by the Ministry of Environment, Water and
Agriculture, and the Agricultural Development Fund is seeking to develop this sector by
modernizing aquaculture to increase its contribution to the economy. This plan will help
achieve self-sufficiency in seafood products, increase the production capacity to 1 million tons
by 2029 in addition to creating more than 400,000 job opportunities for the youth. The main
crops grown in the Kingdom are: Cereals; Wheat, millet, maize, corn, sesame etc., Vegetables;
tomato, potato, marrow, eggplants, okra, carrot, dry onion, cucumber, melon, water melon etc.,
Fruits; dates, citrus fruits, grapes etc.
The total agriculture area cultivated in the Kingdom was estimated to be 857,795 hectares
broken down to cereals 237,442 ha, vegetables (open field) 69,528 ha; vegetables (green
houses) 2,320 ha, fruits 129,540 ha; and the total production of these crops was: 966,516 tons;
122,4183 tons; 174,207 tons; 7,810,035 tons; 1,737,814 tons respectively.
Ministry of Environment, Water and Agriculture (MEWA) has undertaken a number of
initiatives to increase the green cover in the Kingdom. Few important initiatives are (MEWA
Statistical Yearbook, 2019):
• Under the National Program for the Development of fish resources in the Kingdom,
MEWA planned to raise fish production to 100,000 tons/year in 2020, and 600,000 tons/
year by 2030 through optimum utilization of the Kingdom's natural resources in the field
of fish resources.
• The wheat production was banned for a period of three years starting 2016. Also, starting
2018, the Kingdom has decided to stop production of green fodder for a period of no more
than 3 years. The aim was to stop the consumption of large amount of irrigation water
consumed by production of green fodder.
• Planted 276,735 trees in 2019 in the national parks belonging to the ministry.
• Planted 578,419 seedlings as part of afforestation campaigns through the ministry's
branches, associations and memorandum of understanding with government agencies in
the year 2019.
• The ministry in cooperation with the National Center for Vegetation Cover, and the public
and private sectors, has launched the Let's Make It Green campaign. The initiative comes
as part of the ministry's efforts to increase vegetation, reduce desertification, restore
biodiversity, rehabilitate affected natural areas, promote pro-environmental behaviours,
protect the environment and improve the quality of life. The campaign will include 165
sites across all regions of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and will include planting several
national parks, sowing seeds in different regions, afforestation in Najran and Al-Baha
regions, mangrove afforestation project in Makkah and Jazan regions and the cultivation
of sabkhas in several locations. (MEWA Green Campaign, 2020)
1.12 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) of the Kingdom of Saudi
Arabia under the UNFCCC
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia submitted its Updated Nationally Determined Contribution
(NDC) to the UNFCCC Secretariat in October 2021. The updated NDC are aimed to remove,
avoid and reduce GHG emissions by 278 million tons of CO2 eq by 2030 which is more than
two-fold increase compared to the Kingdom’s previous INDC submitted in November 2015.
The Saudi Arabian NDCs are based on the Dynamic baseline approach, taking into
consideration country’s national circumstances (For details, refer to section 3.4).
1.13 Institutional Arrangement
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has over the past years evolved a functional and robust
institutional arrangement. This institutional arrangement has been effective in preparing four
national communications and a biennial update report. This institutional arrangement has been
subjected to modifications to meet the growing reporting and other obligations of the Kingdom
to the UNFCCC and its Paris Agreement.
The DNA is the implementing authority for addressing all reporting obligations of the Kingdom
to the UNFCCC including the National Communications (NCs) and Biennial Update Reports
(BURs). Furthermore, preparing and submitting Biennial Transparency Reports (BTRs) and
National Inventory Reports (NIRs) to be submitted every two years from 2024 onwards under
the Paris Agreement also fall under its responsibilities. (For further details refer to Section 3.9)

National circumstances
Governance
Being a federation comprised of seven emirates, the UAE approaches climate policies through a
comprehensive, whole-government framework that involves various entities, in accordance with
their constitutional legal and executive roles and jurisdictions. In 2022, the UAE established the
UAE Council on Climate Action, an inter-ministerial and inter-emirate governing body, to ensure
consistency and alignment between federal and emirate-level policies and initiatives. The UAE has
demonstrated its commitment to addressing climate change and adapting to its effects through a
series of decisive actions.
In 2017, the UAE introduced the National Climate Change Plan 2017-2050, which serves as a
blueprint for managing GHG emissions, climate adaptation strategies, and promoting economic
diversification through innovation in the private sector. In October 2021, the UAE embarked on a
significant journey towards achieving net-zero emissions with development of the UAE Net Zero
strategy. This initiative marked a strategic milestone and was built upon the foundation of more
than 30 existing strategies spanning all sectors. Concurrently, other policies, such as the UAE
Energy Strategy, Hydrogen Strategy, were revised or developed during the formulation of the
net-zero pathway.
The UAE’s Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative aligns seamlessly with the objectives of the Paris
Agreement, which calls for the implementation of long-term strategies to reduce emissions. The
overarching aim is to attain global net-zero GHG emissions during the latter half of this century.
The governance system of the UAE is founded
on a federal structure established by its
constitution. Following the pattern commonly
observed in federal systems, each of the
individual emirates within the UAE retains
specific powers. At the federal level, the
governance framework encompasses a
network of interconnected governing bodies,
which includes the Federal Supreme Council,
the Federal National Council (a parliamentary
body), the UAE Cabinet, and the Federal
Judiciary—an independent judicial branch.
The Federal Supreme Council holds the
position of the highest constitutional authority in
the UAE. Composed of the rulers of each
constituent emirate, it also functions as the
highest legislative and executive authority,
responsible for formulating general policies
endorsing various federal legislations, and
electing a president from among its members,
who serves a five-year term.
Following this, the Prime Minister/Vice
President proposes the formation of the
Cabinet, which necessitates the president’s
approval. Legislative authority is shared with
the Federal National Council, which engages in
discussions, reviews, and provides
recommendations on federal draft laws,
constitutional amendments, annual budgets,
and international treaties. Comprising 40
members representing all seven emirates, with
half of them directly elected by the citizenry and
the other half appointed, the Federal National
Council wields substantial influence in the
process of crafting new legislation, given that
most of their suggestions and amendments
have been put into effect.
The Federal National Council (FNC) serves as
the consultative and parliamentary body within
the UAE. The FNC holds membership in both
the International Parliamentary Union (IPU) and
the Arab Parliamentary Union (APU). Its
primary roles encompass:
• Evaluating, modifying, or declining federal
draft laws, including those related to
financial matters.
• Reviewing the draft law for the Annual
General Budget and the draft law for the
final accounts.
• Deliberating international treaties and
agreements.
• Engaging in discussions concerning
general topics pertaining to the Federation
and providing recommendations on these
matters.
The executive arm of the UAE, known as the
Cabinet or the Council of Ministers, is
responsible for managing all domestic and
international matters of the Federation in
accordance with the UAE Constitution and
federal laws. It operates under the oversight of
the President and the Federal Supreme
Council.
The Cabinet is composed of the following
members:
• The Prime Minister
• Two Deputy Prime Ministers
• The Ministers of the UAE
• An operational General Secretariat staffed
with several employees who assist in its
daily operations.
The Federal Judiciary, whose autonomy is
safeguarded by the Constitution, encompasses
the Supreme Court and the Courts of First
Instance. The Federal Supreme Court is
comprised of five judges appointed by the
Supreme Council. These judges preside over
matters related to the constitutionality of laws,
disputes between emirates, and conflicts
between individual emirates and the federal
government.
As the UAE embarks on a new phase marked
by economic, political, and social growth, H.H.
Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the
President of the UAE, in conjunction with H.H.
Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum,
the Vice-President and Prime Minister of the
UAE and the Ruler of Dubai, introduced the
“Principles of the 50.” This framework
establishes key priorities for the UAE
government and its agencies, delineating the
objectives for the forthcoming stage of the
UAE’s development journey.
The local governments of the seven emirates
in the United Arab Emirates exhibit variations
in size and organizational structures,
depending on factors such as population,
geographical area, and development levels.
Each emirate operates with an executive
council functioning under the supervision of the
emirate’s Ruler’s Court, alongside several
autonomous agencies with distinct powers.
Here is an overview of the local government
structures in each of the seven emirates:
Abu Dhabi:
Abu Dhabi features a central governing body
known as the Executive Council, which assists
the Ruler in executing their duties and powers.
Several departments and municipalities
operate under this Council, implementing the
emirate’s policies. Abu Dhabi is divided into
three primary regions, each with a dedicated
municipality to manage local affairs.
Additionally, the emirate hosts the National
Consultative Council (NCC), comprising 60
members selected from the main tribal and
familial groups.
Dubai:
Dubai’s main decision-making government
entity is the Dubai Executive Council (DEC),
responsible for maintaining the city’s security,
public utilities, and fostering economic and
social progress. DEC collaborates with the
Ruler of Dubai, in devising development plans
and local legislation.
Sharjah:
Sharjah’s local government structure includes
an Executive Council and a Consultative
Council. The emirate practices decentralization
by devolving authority on a local basis with
branches of the Emiri Diwan, led by Deputy
Chairmen in locations such as Kalba and Khor
Fakkan.
The remaining emirates also maintain a similar
pattern, consisting of Councils, municipalities,
departments, and autonomous agencies as
part of their local government structures.

Geography and Topography
The UAE, situated in the Middle East within the
Gulf region between latitudes 22.0 o and 26.5 o
North and about 51.0 o and 56.5 o East, has a
predominantly flat terrain. It encompasses a
coastal plain that transitions into expansive
desolate desert expanses adorned with rolling
sand dunes. Additionally, there are mountainous
regions located in the eastern part of the
country. The geographical diversity of the UAE
makes it imperative to establish a stringent
climate change framework to sustainably
preserve and enrich the existing ecosystems.
Total land area is about 71,023.6 square
kilometers. There are seven emirates that make
up the UAE — the emirates of Abu Dhabi,
Dubai, Sharjah, Umm-al-Quwain, Ajman, Ras Al
Khaimah and Fujairah. Ongoing land
reclamation projects in the Gulf are extending
the coastline and increasing the total land area
of the UAE. As the largest emirate, Abu Dhabi
takes up over 80% of the UAE’s total area,
about 59,434.7 square kilometers, followed by
Dubai and Sharjah. The smallest emirate,
Ajman, encompasses just 268.2 square
kilometers. The UAE has around 200 islands
and the country shares significant portions of its
borders with Oman (410 km) and Saudi Arabia
(457 km), and has a coastline that extends for
about 1,318 kilometers (819 miles) 6 .This arid landscape is characterized by a diverse array of geographical features, including sand
dunes, oases, rocky-mountains, valleys, marshes, mangroves, and salt plains. The oases are
primarily populated by date palms, with a significant number of them situated in the emirate of Abu
Dhabi.
To the east, the country is bordered by the Hajjar Mountains, which run from north to south. These
mountains are complemented by valleys known as “wadis” in Arabic. Typically dry, these wadis
come to life during the cooler months when rainfall transforms them into vibrant watercourses with
brooks and pools.
Wetland and marine ecosystems
The UAE has diverse marine life residing in its
seas, including various fish species,
invertebrates, and other marine creatures.
Particularly, the southwestern waters of Abu
Dhabi, the Marawah Marine Biosphere Reserve
in Abu Dhabi, Jebel Ali in Dubai, Sir Bu Na’air
Island, and Khor Kalba in Sharjah are globally
recognized for their exceptional biodiversity and
ecological significance. These marine habitats
not only provide a haven for marine organisms
but also serve as crucial defences against
coastal erosion and contribute to mitigating
climate change The distribution of marine life is influenced by
several factors, including surface type, tidal
patterns, water currents, wave exposure,
temperature, and salinity levels. The marine
biodiversity of the UAE is characterized by a
wide array of fish, aquatic plants, and coral
formations. The Arabian Gulf is home to
significant populations of dugongs, eight
species of dolphins, and marine turtles. The
green turtle, in particular, is prevalent, with a
diet primarily consisting of the extensive
seagrass beds found in shallow waters.
Hawkbill turtles are known to frequently nest
on the UAE’s coastlines and islands, while
green turtles have been spotted to sporadically
nest.
Mangroves, referred to as “qurms” in Arabic,
play a vital role in the marine ecosystem. They
are a distinctive feature of the UAE’s coastal
regions. Along with the Coral reefs they serve
as vital habitats for numerous marine
creatures. These areas are essential for fish
breeding and feeding, in addition to
safeguarding the shores from coastal erosion.
Unfortunately, these fragile ecosystems face
threats from coastal development, fishing
activities, anchoring, and the actions of
uninformed divers. Coral reefs are highly
sensitive to changes in their environment and
require decades to regenerate. The
predominant marine life categories in the UAE
coastal regions encompass fish, marine
mammals, birds, and marine reptiles.
Salt plains, known as “sabkhas” in Arabic, are
also commonly found in the country’s
landscape. These present-day sabkhas began
forming around 4,000 years ago.
Climate
The Arabian Peninsula is known for its limited
water resources and extreme heat. It has an
arid climate characterized by infrequent rainfall
patterns and it falls within the subtropical
region, with scorching summers and relatively
milder to cooler winters. Despite these
challenging environmental conditions, the UAE
has successfully adapted to its arid desert
environment and has built a resilient economy.
However, the ongoing climate crisis is
projected to exacerbate difficulties for the
UAE’s environment, economy, and society, as
depicted in the figure below The UAE is already experiencing severe
climate impacts, with significantly higher
average temperature increases compared to
the global average. Climate projections for the
UAE and the Arabian Gulf region indicate that
these challenges will intensify, leading to
higher temperatures, increased humidity,
longer periods of hot and humid weather,
heavier rainfall, rising sea levels, and
alterations in seawater salinity. Additionally,
there is a heightened likelihood of more
frequent and severe natural disasters. The
UAE has been proactive in addressing the
adverse effects extreme weather conditions
across various sectors, primarily:
Energy
• Rising temperatures and climate change
pose challenges to the domestic power
industry, such as, leading erratic and highly
unpredictable demand, impacting
efficiencies of power plants etc.
• To combat climate change and promote
sustainability, the UAE is expanding its
clean energy generation and exploring
eco-friendly cooling technologies and
refrigerant reduction methods.
• The deployment of smart meters, especially
in Dubai, is aimed at countering energy
efficiency losses.
Infrastructure
• The UAE faces threats to coastal and
offshore infrastructure from extreme
weather events, rising sea levels, and
changes in seawater characteristics.
• To bolster resilience, the UAE promotes the
construction of green buildings and the
refurbishment of existing structures.
• Urban planning, such as the Abu Dhabi
2030 Urban Structure Framework Plan and
the Fujairah 2040 Plan, considers climate-
resilient infrastructure.
Environment
• The UAE’s arid environment is under
pressure from increasing temperatures and
extreme events, impacting ecosystems and
biodiversity.
• The UAE’s Climate Risk Assessment
monitors climate change’s effects on natural
resources and habitats.
• The UAE enforces regulations, establishes
protected areas, and encourages eco-
friendly practices in sectors like fishing and
farming.
• Efforts to protect coral reefs include
monitoring, rehabilitation, and marine
protected areas, covering 12% of territorial
waters.
Climate overview
During the winter season, which spans from
December to March, mean temperatures range
from a mild 18°C to 23°C. As first transitional
period approaches in April and May, mean
temperatures transition to a range of 27°C to
32°C. The summer season, on the other hand,
brings scorching mean temperatures, often
exceeding 50°C, especially in the inland
regions. During this time, the mean
temperature hovers between 33°C and 36°C.
As the country transitions into the second half
of the year in October and November, mean
temperatures settle in the range of 24°C to
29°C. The UAE experiences an annual mean rainfall
of approximately 80 mm per year 7 , based on
data from 2003 to 2022. Notably, the
mountainous and eastern coastal areas
receive a higher amount of rainfall compared to
other regions. In some exceptional instances,
annual rainfall has reached up to 130 mm,
such as in 2006. Thunderstorm activity plays a
significant role in contributing to precipitation,
particularly during the winter months when
western upper air troughs pass through the
region. Summer rainfall tends to be lower,
especially in coastal and inland areas away
from the mountains The UAE also encounters strong north-
westerly winds known as the “Shamal.” These
winds carry blowing sand and dust, primarily
affecting exposed inland areas. Additionally,
they cause rough sea conditions with
significant wave heights. These winds reduce
visibility over inland areas. Fog is a common
weather phenomenon in the UAE, with
radiation fog being the most prevalent type. It
is most prominent during the winter and
transitional months. The UAE experiences a range of extreme
climatic events due to its unique geographical
location, characterized by arid desert
landscapes and a coastline along the Arabian
Gulf. The country encounters a hot desert
climate, with extremely high temperatures
during the summer months. These conditions
often lead to heatwaves, which can pose
significant health risks. Additionally, the UAE is
susceptible to occasional intense rainfall and
associated flash floods, especially during the
winter season. Dust and sandstorms are also
common, causing visibility issues and affecting
air quality. Key observed extreme events
between 2003 to 2022 are illustrated in the
table below: Economy
The UAE’s economy is set to experience
significant growth. The UAE economy has
confirmed a better-than-expected performance
in 2022, where overall real GDP has reached a
healthy growth rate of 7.9%, due to the strong
performance of both oil (9.5%) and non-oil (7.2
%) GDP. The projected real GDP growth in the
UAE for 2023 and 2024 is anticipated to be
3.4% and 4.0%, respectively. These growth
figures for the overall real GDP can be
attributed to a moderation in the expansion of
the non-oil sector in 2023 and 2024, primarily
due to the softening of global demand.
Additionally, there is a notable decline in oil
production expected in 2023, resulting from the
agreed cuts within the OPEC+ alliance, which
is partially reversed in 2024 as certain
production constraints ease. It’s important to
note that the forecasts for both 2023 and 2024
are subject to various uncertainties. These
uncertainties are linked to factors such as the
evolving situations in other countries, the
possibility of a more rapid deceleration in
global economic growth than expected,
potential adjustments in OPEC+ production
cuts, and the likelihood of subdued oil
production among other OPEC+ member
countries.

Over the past half-century, the UAE has
undergone a remarkable economic
transformation. It has shifted from an economy
primarily reliant on pearl diving, fishing, and
trade in the pre-oil era to one heavily centered
on oil production. Following the discovery of oil
reserves, the UAE concentrated on developing
both its physical infrastructure (including roads,
electricity generation, water supply, and ports)
and social infrastructure (such as schools and
healthcare facilities). The rapid economic
expansion necessitated the recruitment of a
significant expatriate workforce, leading to
heightened demand for construction and
infrastructure development.
Despite this pace of growth, the UAE remains
committed to achieving absolute GHG
emissions reductions, aiming to decouple its
economic growth from GHG emissions. The
UAE has consistently prioritized economic
diversification and has made substantial strides
in this regard. The non-oil sector’s share of the
UAE’s GDP has increased from approximately
30-40% in the 1970s to around 72.4% in 2022,
including well-established tourism,
construction, whole and retail trade, and
transportation sectors. The country has also
developed a robust industrial sector,
encompassing emissions-intensive processes
such as cement, steel, aluminium, etc. , which
collectively accounted for approximately 10% of
total GHG emissions in 2021.
The economic objectives set by the UAE for the
year 2030 primarily focus on expeditious
economic recuperation and the resurgence of
growth rates, all of which are aligned with a
carefully planned and gradual trajectory
towards establishing a knowledge-driven
economy. The UAE’s progression into the future
will be influenced by strategic investments in emerging technologies, the implementation of new residency policies aimed at attracting and
retaining top-tier talent, and the introduction of more open and competitive economic policies
designed to bolster the business environment within the nation. The transition to a low-carbon economy
presents an opportunity for further
diversification by fostering a competitive,
innovation-driven economy, transforming
emissions-intensive industries, and positioning
the UAE as an export hub for low-emissions
technologies and fuels. For instance, The
National Hydrogen Strategy 2050 aims to
strengthen the UAE’s position as a producer
and supplier of low-emission hydrogen by
2031. The UAE will achieve this through the
development of supply chains, the
establishment of hydrogen oases and a
dedicated national research and development
centre for hydrogen technologies.
Even as this low-carbon transition gains
momentum, the UAE acknowledges its
responsibility as a reliable energy supplier and
guardian of global energy security. To facilitate
this transition, the UAE is addressing the issue
through engaging in renewable energy
investments globally. The UAE is actively
supporting other nations in their transitions to
renewable energy sources and has already
channelled over USD 50 billion into renewable
energy initiatives spanning 70 countries,
encompassing 27 island nations. The UAE has
outlined plans to inject an additional USD 50
billion into such projects by 2035 8 .
Energy demand
The United Arab Emirates’ (UAE) energy
sector is one of the most dynamic and rapidly
growing in the world, driven by its vast oil and
gas reserves, strategic location, and ambitious
diversification plans. The country is a major
producer and exporter of oil and gas, and its
energy sector plays a critical role in the
national economy. In recent years, the UAE
has been pursuing a strategy of diversifying its
energy mix away from oil and gas and towards
renewable energy sources. The country has
set ambitious targets for renewable energy
deployment, and it is investing heavily in solar,
wind, and nuclear power. The UAE is also
developing a carbon capture and storage
(CCS) industry to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions from its oil and gas sector.

(ecopreneurship) which is an instrumental
program in addressing climate change and
environmental concerns as it educates, foster
innovation, encourage collaboration, and
contribute to both economic growth and job
creation, and build a greener and more
sustainable future for communities worldwide.
Environment
The UAE is characterized by four primary
ecosystems, each contributing to its distinctive
ecological diversity. These ecosystems
comprise the vast desert, which encompasses
80% of the country’s land area, mountainous
regions, wetlands and marine environments.
The UAE’s unique landscape has a wide
variety of plant and animal species, adding to
its ecological significance.
However, the rapid pace of urbanization and
development in the UAE has given rise to a
series of challenges that pose a threat to its
biodiversity. These challenges encompass the
loss and degradation of natural habitats,
pollution, overfishing, and the introduction of
invasive species. Furthermore, the effects of
climate change, such as rising sea levels and
escalating temperatures, exacerbate these
issues, particularly affecting marine and
terrestrial ecosystems.
In response to these pressing challenges, the
UAE has put in place a set of federal laws with
the explicit aim of conserving biodiversity.
These legislative measures include Federal
Law No. 23 of 1999, which focuses on the
safeguarding and enhancement of marine
species, and Federal Law No. 24 of 1999,
centred on environmental protection and
development. Additionally, Federal law No. 11
of 2002 regarding the regulation and control of
international trade in endangered species of
wild fauna and flora. Federal law No. 9 of 2020
on biosafety of Genetically Modified
Organisms. Federal law No. 8 of 2021 on the
access to genetic resources and the fair and
equitable sharing of benefits arising from their
utilization. On the international stage, the UAE
is a signatory to 14 conventions and
organizations related to biodiversity, including
CITES14 , UNCCD 15 , CMS16 , CBD17 , and
Ramsar, underscoring its commitment to global
conservation efforts.

The Ministry of Climate Change and
Environment (MoCCaE) has taken
collaborative steps with relevant sectors to
craft and implement a comprehensive range of
policies. These initiatives span from the
National Biodiversity Strategy and the National
Strategy to Combat Desertification to specific
action plans for safeguarding various species
and ecosystems.
The country is also actively engaged in the
protection, breeding, and reintroduction of
endangered species, and it regulates to
combat invasive species to further enhance its
conservation efforts. The Ministry of Climate
Change and Environment (MoCCaE) has
played a pivotal role in executing significant
collaborative projects with various sectors
dedicated to biodiversity, all aimed at enriching
the national biodiversity database. The results
of these projects are as follows:
• National Red List Project: This initiative
has brought to light the UAE’s role as a
habitat for a diverse array of species. This
includes 58 mammal species, 72
amphibians and reptiles, 167 bird species,
598 plant species, and 272 selected marine
species.
• Important Birds Area Project: The UAE
serves as a crucial host to over 400 species
of migratory birds. This project has
successfully identified 30 areas vital for bird
conservation efforts.
• Key Biodiversity Areas Project: Through
this project, the UAE has pinpointed nine
key biodiversity areas, and notably, five of
these areas have been granted full
protection to safeguard their ecological
importance.
• UAE Ecosystem Accounts Project:
Currently in progress, this project seeks to
provide comprehensive evaluations of the
ecosystem services provided by the UAE’s
natural resources. The primary objective is
to equip decision-makers with the essential
information to make informed choices
regarding land use, investment
opportunities, and business improvements.
The Abu Dhabi Red List for Ecosystems:
this assessment is in coordination with the
IUCN and included the assessment of
terrestrial and marine ecosystems in Abu
Dhabi. The ecosystem Red List will support
efforts to effectively protect threatened habitats
whilst aiding development through encouraging
the growth of the emirate without
compromising the preservation of ecosystems.
In the international arena, the UAE has
garnered acclaim for its conservation
endeavours. This recognition includes the
designation of 10 Wetlands of International
Importance (Ramsar Sites), acknowledgment
of five Ecologically or Biologically Significant
Marine Areas (EBSA), the establishment of two
UNESCO Man and Biosphere Reserves, and
certification of one site by the International
Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) onto
the Green List of Protected and Conserved
Areas, a remarkable achievement for the
region.
These projects and international recognitions
serve as testament to the UAE’s unwavering
commitment to biodiversity conservation and
sustainable development, making it a model for
integrated environmental stewardship.
Coral Conservation:
The UAE is a habitat to around 100 types of
corals. Initiatives such as ‘Creating Super
Corals’ are aimed at rehabilitating areas
affected by climate change and human
activities, with a focus on identifying the most
adaptable coral species.
Chapter One
www.moei.gov.ae5th National Communications Report | 61National circumstances 2023
Mangrove Rehabilitation:
In 2021, the UAE was home to 183 sq. km of
mangroves which was estimated to sequester
4.4 million tons of CO2 annually as per the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) methodology (Source: IPCC 2014
Supplement on Mangroves). This has
increased to approximately 60 million
mangroves, covering an extensive area of
205.7 sq. km 18 in 2022 . The ‘100 million
mangrove planting’ initiative aims to
significantly expand this area to 483 sq. km.
Integrated Approach to Sustainability:
The achievements in biodiversity conservation
are attributed to an integrated approach that
involves not only the government but also the
private sector, non-governmental organizations
(NGOs), and educational institutions. This
collaborative model serves to reinforce the
UAE’s dedication to environmental
conservation and the protection of biodiversity,
highlighting a comprehensive and holistic
commitment to sustainability.
Moreover, the fisheries sector within the UAE
has made substantial economic and social
contributions. In the year 2022, this sector
yielded a total of 65,000 tonnes of fish, with a
market value amounting to AED 1.4 billion.
Furthermore, it furnished employment
opportunities for approximately 30,000
individuals and operated with a fleet
comprising approximately 6,000 boats.
The commercial fisheries landings in 2022
consisted of a diverse array of 60 different
species. Among these species, several stood
out in terms of volume, namely Shekheli
(Lethrinus lentjan), Sheary (Lethrinus
nebulosus), Hamour (Epinephelus Coioides),
Kanaad (Scomberomorus commerson), and
Safi (Siganus canaliculatus). Together, these
species accounted for 43.0% of the total
volume of fish landed.
Encouragingly, the overall status of fish stocks
within the UAE has demonstrated
improvement. There has been a noticeable
increase in the level of Biomass, accompanied
by a decrease in fishing effort, which indicates
a shift towards more sustainable fishing
practices. The Sustainable Exploitation Index
(SEI), a pivotal metric used to gauge the
sustainability of fish stocks, has also displayed
a positive trend. It rose from 41% in 2017 to
59.0% in 2022.
These advancements not only underscore the
economic significance of the fisheries sector
but also emphasize the UAE’s unwavering
dedication to promoting sustainable fishing
practices and the conservation of marine
ecosystems. For further details, refer to the UAE’s

Furthermore, the UAE actively participates in
numerous regional and international dialogues
and environmental conventions, including the
UN Framework Convention on Climate
Change, Convention on Biological Diversity,
UN Convention to Combat Desertification, and
the Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.
Agriculture
Situated within an arid zone where deserts
occupy over three-quarters of its total land
area, the UAE faces environmental challenges
characterized by scant rainfall, high
temperatures, infertile soil, and a scarcity of
natural waterways. In response, the UAE has
undertaken extensive efforts to establish a
sustainable agricultural and animal husbandry
industry capable of enhancing food security
and contributing to the national economy.
Agriculture in the UAE has historical roots in
regions such as Ras Al Khaimah, Fujairah, Al
Ain, and select oases like the Liwa oasis.
However, significant developments have
occurred since 1971, despite facing numerous
obstacles, including water scarcity, salinized
soil, adverse environmental conditions, high
production costs, agricultural pests, and post-
harvest losses. The agricultural sector has
evolved into a technologically advanced
industry, with a pivotal role played by the late
Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan in its
development.

To address water resource preservation, there
has been a strong focus on promoting the
adoption of modern irrigation systems, and
promote drought tolerant crops . The UAE has
initiated a series of strategic endeavours to
revamp the national agricultural sector,
including:
Ag Tech Accelerators
The UAE is committed to driving innovation in
agriculture. In 2019, Abu Dhabi Investment
Office (ADIO) introduced a program to develop
agricultural technologies, valued at US$272
million. So far, ADIO announced partnerships
with seven companies (AeroFarms, Madar,
Farms, RNZ, RDI, Pure Harvest, FreshToHome
and Nanoracks) where these companies
received financial and non-financial incentives
totalling USD 140 million. The research and
technologies developed by these companies
will expand existing capabilities in the UAE’s
AgTech ecosystem and promote innovation in
the sector to address global food security
challenges.
Badia Farms opened the region’s first urban
commercial vertical indoor farm in Dubai in
2018. In 2020, the company launched a large-
scale high-tech vertical farm in Dubai Industrial
City with a capacity to produce 3,500 kg of
fruits and vegetables per year. In addition,
Emirates Airlines built the largest vertical farm
in the world - Bustanica. It is a state-of-the-art
vertical farm that reduces the UAE’s reliance
on fresh produce imports and reduces the
amount of water required to grow produce by
95% by creating the optimal growing
environment for these plants all year round.
The facility spans a 31,000 m2 farm equivalent
to farmland that is two times the area of Dubai
International Airport. In other words it has a
production output equivalent to 900 acres of
farmland at 2,700 kg per day. Pure Harvest
Smart Farms, an Abu Dhabi start-up, is
growing from strength to strength becoming
MENA’s Most Funded Start up 2022, and
growing beyond the UAE exporting both
produce and technology to the region and as
far as Malaysia and Singapore. 2022
witnessed a preliminary agreement with the
Singapore Food Agency to develop the city-
state’s first hybrid greenhouse tomato farm that
is aimed at boosting sustainable food security.
National System for Sustainable Agriculture
Approved by the UAE Cabinet on June 28,
2020, this system seeks to enhance farm
efficiency, promote food self-sufficiency, create
new opportunities, and consistently rank the
agriculture sector among the best. Agriculture
Hydroponics
Agriculture Hydroponics
The UAE’s Ministry of Climate Change and
Environment prioritizes the adoption of
hydroponic technology among farmers, which
involves growing plants with nutrient-rich water
and minimal or no soil. This method can save
up to 70% of water, extend the growing
season, and reduce the use of harmful
chemicals. Currently, over 87 commercial
farms employ this technology.
Organic Farming
The UAE has an organic food certification
scheme that is currently implemented by the
Ministry of Industry and Advanced technology
(MoIAT). This scheme is accompanied by a
logo that allows consumers to easily
differentiate organic products from
conventional ones. Around half of the 40
existing organic farms have already received
certification, while others are in the process.
Chapter One
www.moei.gov.ae5th National Communications Report | 64National circumstances 2023
In addition to technological initiatives, the UAE
has launched programs aimed at fostering
entrepreneurial participation in the agro-based
industry. Notably, the Food and Agriculture
Entrepreneurs Programme, scheduled to run
from 2023 to 2025, will empower young
Emiratis to develop their skills in managing
agriculture and livestock projects. This program
aligns with the “Transformational Projects”
initiative, which supports Emiratis in
establishing their agricultural companies. It
aims to equip participants with knowledge in
agricultural planning, entrepreneurship, and
commercial management of agriculture and
livestock projects, forging partnerships with the
private sector.
Food Tech Valley
UAE’s latest and largest project in the field of
food systems innovation is the Food Tech
Valley in Dubai. The first-of-its-kind agtech city
in the world aims to serve as a testbed for
pioneering agricultural innovations that will
spearhead the regional transformation to more
sustainable food systems. Spanning 16 million
square feet, the Food Tech Valley takes a
holistic approach to agriculture in line with the
objectives of the National Food Security
Strategy 2051 and the National Net Zero by
2050 Pathway. The project seeks to position
the UAE as a leading exporter of sustainable
agricultural solutions. Further information is
available at https:// www.foodtechvalley.ae/.
FoodTech Challenge

implementation of sustainable and technology-
driven solutions across the food value chain,
UAE launched the FoodTech Challenge, the
largest global competition of its kind. The
Challenge is a driving force for innovation for
the UAE’s food security and self-sufficiency at
the national, community, and household levels.
In line with the objectives of the National Food
Security Strategy, the competition calls upon
youth, innovators, entrepreneurs, companies,
and scientific and research institutions from
around the world to identify and propose
ground breaking ideas to enhance food
security in the UAE. In the latest edition, four
winners (out of almost 700 participating teams)
benefited from a $2M award pool consisting of
a cash prize, start-up incentives, acceleration
services, innovation grants, localization
support, and mentorship programs. Further
information is available at www.
foodtechchallenge.com
Furthermore, the Ministry of Climate Change
and Environment (MoCCaE) has seamlessly
incorporated initiatives aimed at promoting and
supporting sustainable agricultural practices
into its Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and
within the framework of the Emirates Food
Security Council. The UAE has established a
series of national committees, each with
specific mandates dedicated to advancing
sustainable practices in agriculture:
UAE Sustainable Farming Mark
A control scheme issued by Ministry of Industry
and Advanced Technology (MoIAT) that
provides the criteria for granting the UAE
sustainable Farming Mark. The scheme
expands with the inclusion of diversified
farming categories including responsible
aquaculture, organic feed, and hydroponics to
cover sustainability requirements that suit the
UAE climate, as well as highlight sustainably
produced products in the market.

Committee for Development of Sustainable Local Production:
This committee focuses on strategies and actions to enhance the sustainability of local agricultural
production.
Food Loss and Waste Committee:
This committee is dedicated to addressing issues related to food loss and waste in the agricultural
sector, seeking to minimize such losses and inefficiencies.
ne’ma
ne’ma, the National Food Loss and Waste Initiative, is a collaborative effort between the Ministry
of Climate Change and Environment and Emirates Foundation. It aims to promote and coordinate
actions among key national stakeholders, including government, private sector, NGOs, and
communities, to combat food loss and waste throughout the entire food supply chain,
encompassing production, distribution, retail, restaurants, and households. The primary goal is to
transform current behaviours and attitudes into new national social norms focused on responsible
consumption, contributing to a reduction in food loss and waste. ne’ma represents a significant
step in the UAE’s commitment to addressing food loss and waste in alignment with the United
Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal 12.3, which seeks to cut food loss and waste by 50% by
2030. To achieve this, ne’ma will establish a national baseline to measure food loss and waste,
identify critical points within the food value chain, explore the root causes of wasteful behaviours,
enhance policies, foster innovative solutions, and raise community awareness through campaigns
and individual success stories, mobilizing collective action.

Moreover, the UAE has developed farmer
incentive programs that have been restructured
to prioritize farmers who adopt sustainable
practices and employ organic farming
methods. These programs have expanded the
list of materials eligible for incentives, ensuring
they are well-suited for UAE’s specific
conditions and are grounded in scientific
research. Some materials, such as those used
in net houses and solar power technology to
boost production and productivity, have been
the subject of research and development
projects conducted within the Ministry.
