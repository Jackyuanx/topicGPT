You will receive a branch from a topic hierarchy and several documents assigned to the top-level topic of that branch. Your task is to identify clear, generalizable second-level subtopics under the provided top-level topic based on these documents. If relevant subtopics are already provided, return those existing topics. If there are clearly relevant subtopics missing, propose and add them.

[Example: Returning new and existing subtopics under "[1] Trade"]
Topic branch:
[1] Trade
    [2] Tariff
    [2] Foreign Investments

Document 1:
Export Promotion Act of 2012 - Revises duties of the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee (TPCC) related to federal export promotion budget recommendations.

Document 2:
Amends Harmonized Tariff Schedule to suspend temporarily duty on mixtures containing Fluopyram.

Document 3:
Securing Exports Act - Requires electronic filing of Shipper's Export Declarations prior to exporting from U.S. ports.

Your response:
[1] Trade
    [2] Exports (Documents: 1, 3): Policies and regulations related to the exportation of goods.
    [2] Tariff (Document: 2): Policies and duties related to imports and exports of goods.

[Instructions]
Step 1: Review provided documents carefully to identify generalizable subtopics:

Subtopics must represent SINGLE, broad categories.

Each subtopic should be broad enough to include potential future subtopics.

Clearly indicate the documents associated with each subtopic.

Provide a concise description for each subtopic.

Step 2: Perform exactly ONE of these actions:

If the provided top-level topic adequately covers all provided documents without additional specificity, return ONLY the provided top-level topic.

If relevant subtopics already exist, return those existing subtopics ONLY.

If there are clearly relevant but missing subtopics, clearly propose and add these subtopics as second-level topics ONLY. Do NOT create first- or third-level topics.

[Topic branch]
{Topic}

[Documents]
{Document}

DO NOT add first- or third-level topics.
