You will receive a branch from a topic hierarchy and several documents assigned to the top-level discussion point of that branch. Your task is to identify clear, generalizable, and classification-driven second-level subtopics under the provided top-level discussion point based on these documents. Subtopics should explicitly highlight meaningful differences suitable for comparative or classification-driven analysis.

If relevant subtopics are already provided and clearly relevant for comparative analysis, return those existing topics only. If there are clearly relevant comparative subtopics missing, propose and add them explicitly.

[Example: Returning new and existing subtopics under "[1] Trade"]
Topic branch:
[1] Trade
[2] Tariff
[2] Foreign Investments

Document 1:
Export Promotion Act of 2012 - Revises duties of the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee (TPCC) related to federal export promotion budget recommendations.

Document 2:
Amends Harmonized Tariff Schedule to suspend temporarily duty on mixtures containing Fluopyram.

Document 3:
Securing Exports Act - Requires electronic filing of Shipper's Export Declarations prior to exporting from U.S. ports.

Your response:
[1] Trade
[2] Exports (Documents: 1, 3): Differences in policies and regulatory frameworks governing the exportation of goods.
[2] Tariff (Document: 2): Differences in tariff regulations and duty policies related to imported and exported goods.

[Instructions]
Step 1: Review provided documents carefully to identify generalizable, classification-driven subtopics:

Subtopics must represent SINGLE, broad categories explicitly suited for highlighting comparative differences.

Each subtopic should be broad enough to support potential future detailed comparative analyses.

Clearly indicate the documents associated with each subtopic.

Provide a concise, classification-driven description for each subtopic.

Step 2: Perform exactly ONE of these actions:

If the provided top-level discussion point adequately covers all provided documents without additional specificity, return ONLY the provided top-level discussion point.

If relevant subtopics already exist and suit comparative analysis, return those existing subtopics ONLY.

If there are clearly relevant but missing subtopics for comparative analysis, propose and add these explicitly as second-level subtopics ONLY. Do NOT create first- or third-level topics.

[Topic branch]
{Topic}

[Documents]
{Document}

DO NOT add first- or third-level topics.
