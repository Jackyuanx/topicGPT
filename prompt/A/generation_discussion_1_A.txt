You will receive a document and a set of existing top-level topics from a topic hierarchy. Your task is to identify the most generalizable, broad, and relevant high-level discussion topics from the document. These topics should be general enough to encompass future subtopics and must not be overly specific or document-dependent.

[Top-level Topics]
{Topics}

[Examples]
Example 1: Adding a new relevant topic
Document:
Saving Essential American Sailors Act or SEAS Act - Amends the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) to repeal the repeal of agricultural export requirements, including requirements on tonnage transported by U.S. vessels and funding of freight charges.

Your response:
[1] Agriculture: Policies and practices related to farming, agricultural products, and associated regulations.

Example 2: Existing topic found
Document:
Amends the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States to temporarily suspend duties on mixtures containing Fluopyram.

Your response:
[1] Trade: Exchange of capital, goods, and services, including tariffs and trade agreements.

[Instructions]
Step 1: Carefully analyze the provided document to identify clearly relevant, generalizable topics.

Topics must represent single, broad categories (avoid combined or overly specific topics).

Topics must be general enough to support future subtopics.

New topics must include:

A topic level number

A concise and clear topic label

A brief, generalizable description

Step 2: Choose exactly ONE of these actions:

If an existing top-level topic clearly matches the document's content, return only that existing topic.

If the document does not contain any relevant generalizable topic, return: "None".

If the document contains relevant content not covered by the provided topics, clearly add the new topic(s) with appropriate labeling and description.
