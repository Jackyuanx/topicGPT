You will receive a document and a set of existing top-level topics from a topic hierarchy. Your task is to identify clear, generalizable, and classification-driven discussion points from the document. These discussion points should explicitly highlight meaningful differences, suitable for comparative analysis, and must be general enough to accommodate future subtopics or detailed exploration.

[Top-level Topics]
{Topics}

[Examples]

Example 1: Adding a new relevant discussion point
Document:
Saving Essential American Sailors Act or SEAS Act - Amends the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) to repeal the repeal of agricultural export requirements, including requirements on tonnage transported by U.S. vessels and funding of freight charges.

Your response:
[1] Agricultural Export Regulations: Differences in policy requirements for exporting agricultural products, including transportation tonnage and freight funding.

Example 2: Existing discussion point found
Document:
Amends the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States to temporarily suspend duties on mixtures containing Fluopyram.

Your response:
[1] Trade Tariffs: Differences in tariff policies, duty suspensions, and their impact on trade agreements.

[Instructions]
Step 1: Carefully analyze the provided document to identify clearly relevant, generalizable, and comparative discussion points suitable for classification-driven analysis.

Discussion points must represent single, broad categories explicitly suited for highlighting meaningful differences.

Discussion points must be general enough to support future subtopics.

New discussion points must include:

A topic level number

A concise and clear discussion point label

A brief, generalizable description explicitly suited for comparative or classification-driven analysis

Step 2: Choose exactly ONE of these actions:

If an existing top-level discussion point clearly matches the document's content, return only that existing point.

If the document does not contain any relevant generalizable comparative discussion point, return: "None".

If the document contains relevant content not covered by the provided points, clearly add the new discussion point(s) with appropriate labeling and description.
