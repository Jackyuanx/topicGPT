Carefully analyze the two provided documents and classify content clearly according to each provided key discussion point. For each discussion point:

Determine whether the content appears in:

Document A only

Document B only

Both Documents

Neither Document (insufficient information)

Provide your classification clearly and concisely for each discussion point.

Step 2: Comparative Analysis

Based on your classification from Step 1:

If the content appears in both documents, provide a comprehensive discussion highlighting similarities and differences explicitly.

If the content appears in only one document, clearly state this and summarize the content accurately.

If the content appears in neither document, respond explicitly with: "There is not enough info to answer the question."

Maintain strict accuracy, do not generate assumptions or information beyond what is explicitly provided in the documents.
