{"id":1,"text":",Introduction,Climate change adaptation holds equal significance to mitigation in the UAE, given that the,country is susceptible to climate change consequences that resemble those experienced by other,countries in the region. These potential effects encompass alterations in meteorological patterns,,elevated temperatures in both air and seawater, rising sea levels, and an escalation in extreme,weather occurrences. The UAE occupies a coastal region characterized by extreme aridity, where,the average annual rainfall is less than 100 mm, and water resources are scarce. During the,summer months, the temperature and humidity levels soar, with peak temperatures exceeding,49\u00b0C and humidity levels approaching 100% on exceptionally humid days.,Consequently, the projected effects of climate change will impact the UAE directly and indirectly,,touching upon its economy, environment, and societal well-being. These anticipated adverse,effects will ripple through marine and terrestrial ecosystems, agricultural productivity, and the,accessibility of water resources. Moreover, the rising sea levels pose a potential threat to vital,UAE infrastructure, including desalination and power facilities, as well as habitats situated along,coastal areas bordering the Arabian Gulf or the Gulf of Oman.,Considering the anticipated climate change,challenges, the UAE is actively rolling out a,comprehensive set of policies and initiatives at,both the national and local levels. These efforts,are aimed at enhancing resilience to climate,change and mitigating its impacts, with some,initiatives yielding co-benefits for mitigation.,The decision-making process is grounded in,extensive stakeholder engagement, which,includes private sector participation, and is,guided by the latest scientific research, to,effectively bridge the gap between science and,policy.,Moving forward, the National Climate Change,Plan will entail the development of in-depth,adaptation strategies for various key sectors,,aiming to minimize vulnerabilities and bolster,the UAE\u2019s capacity to adapt. The National,Climate Change Plan focuses on three key,objectives (i) manage GHG emissions, (ii) build,climate resilience by managing risk and,building adaptive capacity; (iii) advance UAE\u2019s,economic diversification agenda through,innovative solutions. Noting that National GHG,emission management systems, national,adaptation planning and management, and,private sector-based innovative diversification,programs are key climate priorities of the,country.,In line with National Climate Change Plan in,2017, MOCCAE established National Climate,Change Adaptation Program in 2018. Acquiring,an enhanced understanding of climate impacts,,prioritizing high risks, and identifying,adaptation options. Under this program,,MOCCAE conducted climate change risk,assessments for the priority sectors in 2019,and planning implementable adaptation,strategies from there onwards. Followed by,mainstreaming adaptation strategies in 2025,and conducting monitoring and evaluation to,ensure evidence-based adaptation in 2030-,2050.,MOCCAE published Risk assessment reports,in 2019 for priority sectors: Public Health,,Energy, Infrastructure, Environment, and,Insurance sector newly added (in 2021-22).,For each sector, actionable adaptation plans,are currently in the process of development at,the emirate level, aligning with the,requirements of the National Adaptation Plan,(NAP). These plans are designed to effectively,address the high-priority risks that have,previously been identified. The overarching,goal of the NAP is to emphasize, integrate,,execute, and oversee adaptation strategies,across various sectors, involving all relevant,stakeholders within both governmental and,non-governmental domains. These plans will,encompass detailed information regarding,specific actions, the responsible leaders and,supporting participants, timelines, metrics for,monitoring and evaluation, as well as,preliminary cost estimates and anticipated,impacts. This comprehensive approach is,intended to mainstream climate change,adaptation and bolster resilience within sector-,specific development strategies while,identifying crucial projects and action plans for,funding. Through the NAP, the UAE is,proactively enhancing its capacity to adapt to,the challenges of climate change by,pinpointing both short-term and long-term,priority adaptation measures.,Methodology Adopted for Climate Risk,Assessment,The methodology used to carry out climate risk,assessment adopted the guiding formula for,calculating \u201crisk based on the magnitude and,likelihood of the climate impacts\u201d. The 5 Step,approach is adopted which includes stock-,taking, identifying potential impacts, evaluating,impacts, assessing, and prioritizing risks, and,identifying adaptation measures together with,stakeholder consultation and monitoring and,reviewing mechanisms.,","responses":"[1] Climate Change: Addresses the impacts, adaptation strategies, and policies related to climate change and its effects on the environment, economy, and society."}
{"id":2,"text":",As a small, low-lying island city-state, Singapore is highly vulnerable,to the impacts of climate change. Singapore is also one of the,most densely populated countries in the world. It is thus important,for Singapore to prepare for and adapt early to climate change.,Effects of Climate Change,The IPCC Working Group I Report for the AR6,cycle has warned us that the global climate will,change significantly unless rapid and drastic,reductions in emissions are taken. Global,temperatures are projected to very likely rise by,1.0\u20135.7 \u00b0C by the end of the century from pre-,industrial levels, while global mean sea levels are,likely expected to increase by 0.28 m to 1.01 m,over the same period, relative to 1995\u20132014 sea,levels. Extreme weather events (such as heavy,rainfall) over the region are also projected to be,more intense and frequent. The IPCC Working,Group II Report further cautions that widespread,climate impacts are already being felt across the,world, with some of these effects irreversibly and,disproportionately affecting vulnerable countries,,notably small island developing states (SIDS).,The window for securing a liveable future is,rapidly closing.,The Centre for Climate Research Singapore,(CCRS), in partnership with the UK,Meteorological Office, concluded Singapore\u2019s,Second National Climate Change Study (V2) in,2015, which made use of data and scenarios from,the IPCC\u2019s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) to,examine the long-term effects of climate change,in Singapore. The study found that by 2100, the,mean sea level around Singapore could rise,by up to a metre and mean temperatures could,increase by up to 4.6 \u00b0C. The CCRS has embarked,on the Third National Climate Change Study (V3),to provide updated climate projections by 2023,,which will incorporate the latest findings from,IPCC AR6.,Preparing Singapore for the Impact of,Climate Change,The impacts of climate change are already being,felt in Singapore. 2012 to 2021 was Singapore\u2019s,warmest decade since Singapore began local,temperature recordings in 1929. In 2021, Singapore,also experienced record rainfalls in January, April,and August, leading to flash floods in various parts,of Singapore. Sea levels around the island rose by,14 cm from 1979 to 2019.,Even with international efforts to limit the rise in,global temperatures, there is a need to prepare,Singapore for the impacts of climate change. Some,adaptation measures require longer lead times,to implement and have to be undertaken early.,Adaptation plans must also be adaptive to climate,uncertainties and evolving climate science.,To coordinate such efforts, a multi-agency,Resilience Working Group (RWG), led by the,Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment,(MSE) and the Ministry of National Development,(MND), was set up in 2010 under the IMCCC. The,RWG assesses Singapore\u2019s physical vulnerabilities,to climate change based on a Resilience,Framework, which guides the formulation of,adaptation plans up to 2100 (see the next page for,Singapore\u2019s Resilience Framework),The RWG comprises 20 agencies which oversee,key sectoral risks and efforts in enhancing,Singapore\u2019s adaptive capacity, strengthening,resilience capabilities, and reducing vulnerability,to climate change. The inter-agency effort ensures,that adaptation plans are coordinated across the,Government. The agencies involved are:,\u25cb Building and Construction Authority (BCA);,\u25cb Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS);,\u25cb Centre for Liveable Cities (CLC);,\u25cb Energy Market Authority (EMA);,\u25cb Housing & Development Board (HDB);,\u25cb Info-comm Media Development Authority,(IMDA);,\u25cb JTC Corporation (JTC);,\u25cb Land Transport Authority (LTA);,\u25cb Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore,(MPA);,\u25cb Ministry of Finance (MOF);,\u25cb Ministry of Health (MOH);,\u25cb Ministry of National Development (MND);,\u25cb Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment,(MSE);,\u25cb National Environment Agency (NEA);,\u25cb National Parks Board (NParks);,\u25cb Prime Minister\u2019s Office - Strategy Group,,National Climate Change Secretariat,(PMO-SG\/NCCS);,\u25cb PUB, Singapore\u2019s National Water Agency;,\u25cb Singapore Food Agency (SFA);,\u25cb Singapore Land Authority (SLA); and,\u25cb Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA),RWG has identified six key adaptation risk areas,for Singapore.,","responses":"[1] Climate Change: Discusses the impacts, adaptation measures, and resilience strategies related to climate change, particularly in vulnerable regions like small island states."}
