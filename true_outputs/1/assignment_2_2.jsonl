{"id":2,"text":",Saudi Arabia is an arid country characterized by low rainfall, high temperatures and limited,water resources. There are no perennial rivers in the country. The main water resources in the,country are surface water runoff, shallow and deep groundwater, desalinated seawater and,wastewater. surface water is limited to rainfall runoff flowing through valleys. Saudi Arabia,consists of a variety of habitats which includes deserts, plains, plateaus, mountains and lava,flows. The three major bodies of sand in the Kingdom are the Great Nafud in the north, the,Empty Quarter in the south and Ad-Dahna; a crescent-shaped body of sand connecting Nafud,and Rub Al-Khali deserts.,The Kingdom is one of the world's largest oil exporters, with a single-source economy heavily,reliant on oil income. The Kingdom's primary development agenda, the Saudi Vision 2030,,was announced in 2016. This development strategy serves as the main vehicle for diversifying,the Kingdom's economy away from reliance on a single source of revenue. For the realization,and achievement of the 96 strategic objectives of Saudi Vision 2030, 13 Vision Realization,Programs (VRPs) have been established by the Council of Economic and Development Affairs,(CEDA). The VRPs aim to develop a diversified economy encompassing all sectors to ensure,homogeneous development. The Financial Sector Development Program has the goal of,advancing the financial sector of the Kingdom through support provided to the private sector,,formation of a state-of-the-art capital market and enabling the diversification of the sources of,income and investment. The National Transformation Program (NTP) intends to improve,living standards for all in the Kingdom through increasing the ease of access to healthcare and,promoting a sustainable approach towards national resources such as food security and access,to water. The National Companies Promotion Program is dedicated to promoting 100+ local,and regional companies to become global leaders, thereby displaying the economic strength of,the Kingdom on the global platform. Through the Fiscal Balance Program, the Kingdom is,pursuing its goals of maximizing oil and non-oil revenues through improved efficiency and,risk management and mitigation strategies. VRPs are essential to realizing the objectives of,Saudi Vision 2030 and ensuring that the Kingdom stays firm upon its path to sustainable,development and diversification of its economy. An impressive progress has been reflected for,different programs under the Vision Realization Programs in the Vision progress report for the,period 2016-2020.,Saudi Vision 2030 provides a roadmap towards achieving sustainable development through,social and economic reforms. The roadmap focuses on the development of service sectors like,health, education, infrastructure and tourism and therefore increasing employment,opportunities and diversifying the economy. Furthermore, despite the major health and,economic crisis arising owing to the novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID 19), the Kingdom,is committed to its economic diversification initiatives with the continued sustainable,development agenda. The Kingdom has embarked upon the mega projects namely NEOM,,AMAALA, AL-ULA, Qiddiya, Red Sea Project and Prince Mohammad bin Salman Nature,Reserve.,Saudi Arabia, due to its arid environment and sensitive ecosystem is vulnerable to bio-physical,impacts of climate change. The socioeconomic impacts of climate change response measures by other countries also make Saudi Arabia vulnerable to climate change due to its reliance,mainly on single source.,Saudi Arabia has launched two green initiatives in 2021 namely Saudi Green Initiative (SGI),and Middle East Green Initiative (MGI) under the patronage of HRH Prince Mohammed bin,Salman bin Abdulaziz, the Crown Prince, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Defense and,Chairman of the Saudi Council of Economic and Development Affairs.,The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia submitted its Updated Nationally Determined Contribution,(NDC) to the UNFCCC Secretariat in October 2021. The updated NDC is aimed to remove,,avoid and reduce GHG emissions by 278 million tons of CO2 eq by 2030 which is more than,two-fold increase compared to the Kingdom\u2019s previous INDC submitted in November 2015.,The updated NDC show a progression and highest possible ambition. These NDC are based on,the principles listed in Article 3 of UNFCCC and Articles 4.1, 4.7 and 4.15 of the Paris,Agreement and Conference of Parties Decisions 1\/CP.19, 1CP.20, 1\/CP.21 and 1\/CP.24 and,the approach specified in the economic diversification initiative adopted as the Conference of,Parties Decision 24\/CP.18 in 2012 in Doha.,The Saudi Arabian NDC are based on the Dynamic baseline approach, taking into,consideration country\u2019s national circumstances.,The dynamic baseline scenarios are based on the ability of the Kingdom to grow and diversify,its economy, keeping in mind that the Kingdom is not seeking financial support towards,achieving its NDC. The achievement of NDC is also incumbent upon sustainable economic,growth and diversification of the Kingdom\u2019s economy, while preserving Kingdom\u2019s leading,role in promoting security and stability of global energy markets. The Kingdom will use the,best suited technologies to achieve its NDC using Circular Carbon Economy (CCE) approach.,The Saudi Green Initiative (SGI) is a multidimensional initiative which contributes towards,achieving the climate ambitions of the Kingdom. The SGI roadmap consisted of over 60,initiatives. The roadmap includes reducing carbon emissions by implementing energy,efficiency programs, developing carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) technology,,increasing public transportation and increasing renewable energy capacity. The five initiatives,which will help the Kingdom achieve its NDC under SGI are; enhance SEEP by 2025, use,captured carbon to produce chemicals and synthetic fuels by 2030, changing the energy mix,towards a more sustainable one by 2030, become the world\u2019s leading hydrogen producer and,exporter by 2030 and waste management transformation in Riyadh by 2035. The other,initiatives under SGI are green Saudi Arabia initiative by planting 450 million trees all over,the Kingdom by 2030 and protecting land and sea by increasing the terrestrial and marine,protected areas to 20% of the Kingdom\u2019s total area by 2030.,Saudi Arabia also announced the Middle East Green Initiative (MGI), a regional initiative to,lead and support regional efforts to achieve global climate ambitions, with a focus on actions,and cooperation to accomplish climate aspirations. These initiatives include:,(i) Encourage GCC and Middle Eastern countries to implement circular carbon economy,projects and activities to boost the usage of clean energy and reduce greenhouse gas,emissions in the region.,(ii) Establish a regional center for Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (CCUS) in,Arabian Gulf States (GCC countries and Iraq).,(iii) Support and facilitate access to clean energy for cooking in the middle east regions and,raising the health and lifespan of clean fuel users specially women and children and,reduce the GHG emissions.,(iv) Clean Oceans and Rivers Initiative by participating in the cleanup of oceans and rivers,of plastic waste in the middle east region.,The Kingdom is providing leadership in the area of circular carbon economy as a vehicle for,implementing its updated nationally determined contribution. Saudi Arabia adopted the,concept of the circular carbon economy as the framework for its climate policy. The CCE,embraces a technology-neutral approach that caters for all possible solutions without prejudice,to, or predisposition against, any single option. Circular carbon economy involves a stepwise,closure of the carbon cycle via utilization or conversion of CO2 generated from the combustion,of fossil fuels leading to significant reduction of carbon emissions. The CCE is based on four,R\u2019s; reduce, reuse, recycle and remove for the management of carbon in the CCE. Within the,framework of circular carbon economy, three types of carbon have been identified namely the,\u2018Living Carbon\u2019 which resides in the biosphere and it naturally balances with the atmosphere,and is the basis of life. The second is the \u2018Durable Carbon\u2019 which resides in the techno-sphere,and is used in a range of applications, from long-term infrastructure to recycled plastics. The,third is the Fugitive Carbon\u2019 which is released into the environment as excess anthropogenic,carbon dioxide in the atmosphere or as plastics in the ocean. All the 4Rs of the circular carbon,economy serve to minimize fugitive carbon.,This report, the Fourth National Communication (NC4) of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has,been prepared by the Designated National Authority (DNA) in close cooperation and,coordination of relevant sector ministries, entities and other stakeholders.

The,third is the Fugitive Carbon\u2019 which is released into the environment as excess anthropogenic,carbon dioxide in the atmosphere or as plastics in the ocean. All the 4Rs of the circular carbon,economy serve to minimize fugitive carbon.,This report, the Fourth National Communication (NC4) of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has,been prepared by the Designated National Authority (DNA) in close cooperation and,coordination of relevant sector ministries, entities and other stakeholders.
